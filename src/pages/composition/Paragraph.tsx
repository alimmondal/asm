              For healthy living, the main elements of environment such as air,
              water and soil, should be free from pollution. But when the
              balance of these elements hampered, it is called environment
              pollution. <strong>(air pollution/water pollution)</strong>. These
              pollutions are a great threat to our existence. They cause various
              human diseases. These diseases may lead a man to death. It changes
              world’s climate and increase temperature. This reduces human
              capacity to work. It also causes natural disasters like cyclone.

              there is a prover that (it) cost nothing but brings many things.
              This separates a good man from a bad man. A man who posses this is
              loved by all. For example, a business man is loved by his
              customers for this quality. A service holder is loved by his
              colleagues and bosses. So, success in every sphere of life largely
              depends on (it) . It's preferable to wealth because one may have
              vast property but he is hated only for the absence of it. So, to
              maintain peace in society, we also must have it to be an ideal
              social being. Hence, all of us should try our best to possess this
              valuable quality in our lives for our own interest.

              work with fish there in my leisure, especially in the afternoon. I
              grow different types of flowers, fish, and vegetables—rose,
              raganiganda, kamini, marigold, belli, etc. I also cultivate some
              vegetables. I weed out grass, give fertilizers, and water the

              pond. My joys know no bound when I see the flowers and vegetables.

              TV, a film, or a book is a wonderful gift of science. It gives us

              by Shakespeare, which I have enjoyed. In it, Hamlet, Prince of
              Scotland, is the tragic hero whose father is murdered by his
              uncle. His uncle also married his mother. For this reason, he
              tried to take revenge on his uncle, but he hesitated again and
              again. Ultimately, he succeeded. Here, the theme of hesitation is
              a great lesson for us. Thus, the book, film, program, or TV serial
              gives us entertainment as well as instruction. It also refreshes
              our mind. I think if anyone watches or reads this program, serial,
              film, or book, they need not read or watch anything else to get a
              true picture of the human mind. I read or watched the program or
              book eagerly. The program or book enticed me very much.

              Road accident is a pressing issue in Bangladesh, posing a great
              threat to public safety and aggravating its transportation system.
              Despite efforts to improve road conditions and enforce traffic
              regulations, the densely populated streets and highways remain
              prone to accidents. Factors such as reckless driving, overloading
              of vehicles, inadequate road maintenance, contribute to the
              alarming frequency of accidents. The consequences of these
              accidents are dire, causing not only loss of lives but also
              inflicting serious injuries and property damage. necessary
              measures are needed to solve this crisis, including enforcement of
              traffic laws, investment in road infrastructure, public awareness.
              Only by these steps, we can hope to reduce road accidents and

            <p>
              Price hikes have become a great concern in Bangladesh, exerting a
              pressure on its economy and the daily lives of its citizens.
              inflation, supply chain disruptions, fluctuating global commodity
              prices, and domestic production challenges are the causes of price
              hikes. The impact of price increases is felt across various
              sectors, affecting everything from food and fuel to healthcare and
              education. Vulnerable populations often bear the brunt of these
              hikes, as their purchasing power erodes, making it increasingly
              difficult to make ends meet. The government's efforts to control
              and mitigate these price hikes through policy interventions,
              subsidies, and market regulations are crucial in alleviating the
              burden on the populace. Long-term strategies that focus on
              bolstering domestic production, improving infrastructure, and a
              lasting economy are essential to check the bad effects of price
              hikes and ensuring prosperous future for Bangladesh.
