                1952, we got Bangla as state language from Pakistan by
                sacrificing many lives. In 1997, this day is declared as
                International mother language day by UNICEF.

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Answer: </strong> TV, a film, or a book is a wonderful
                gift of science. It gives us knowledge, education, and
                recreation. Numerous programs are telecast on it. My favorite TV
                program, film, or book is Hamlet, by Shakespeare, which I have
                enjoyed. In it, Hamlet, Prince of Scotland, is the tragic hero
                whose father is murdered by his uncle. His uncle also married
                his mother. For this reason, he tried to take revenge on his
                uncle, but he hesitated again and again. Ultimately, he
                succeeded. Here, the theme of hesitation is a great lesson for
                us. Thus, the book, film, program, or TV serial gives us
                entertainment as well as instruction. It also refreshes our
                mind. I think if anyone watches or reads this program, serial,
                film, or book, they need not read or watch anything else to get
                a true picture of the human mind. I read or watched the program
                or book eagerly. The program or book enticed me very much.

          <p className="text-start">
            <strong>Answer: </strong> Road accident is a pressing issue in
            Bangladesh, posing a great threat to public safety and aggravating
            its transportation system. Despite efforts to improve road
            conditions and enforce traffic regulations, the densely populated
            streets and highways remain prone to accidents. Factors such as
            reckless driving, overloading of vehicles, inadequate road
            maintenance, contribute to the alarming frequency of accidents. The
            consequences of these accidents are dire, causing not only loss of
            lives but also inflicting serious injuries and property damage.
            necessary measures are needed to solve this crisis, including
            enforcement of traffic laws, investment in road infrastructure,
            public awareness. Only by these steps, we can hope to reduce road
            accidents and making its streets safer for all.

          <p className="text-start">
            <strong>Answer: </strong> Price hikes have become a great concern in
            Bangladesh. Inflation, supply chain disruptions, fluctuating global
            commodity prices, and domestic production challenges are the causes
            of price hikes. The impact of price increases is felt everywhere.
            Vulnerable populations often bear the brunt of these hikes, as their
            purchasing power erodes. The government's efforts to control and
            mitigate these price hikes are crucial in alleviating the burden on
            the populace. Long-term strategies are essential to check the bad
            effects of price hikes and ensuring prosperous future for
            Bangladesh.
