            On February 1, 2024 I bought a book set (Order No. 000154) to be
            delivered to Chandigarh, Sector-20. To my dismay, I have not

            To resolve the problem, I would appreciate it if you could replace
            the wrong book set with the one originally ordered. Please let me
            know as soon as possible what action you propose to take.I look
            forward to hearing from you within the next ten days. Enclosed are
            copies of the transaction document and the receipt. I look forward
            to your reply and a resolution to my problem and will wait until the
            aforementioned time before seeking help from a consumer protection
            agency or the Better Business Bureau. Please contact me at the above
            address or by phone at 098100XXXXX. <br />
