                  Thanks to science which has changed the world of Adam and Eve
                  by its amazing modern technologies. [Mobile phone, internet]
                  are some of them. We cannot think of modern life without the

                  <br />
                  With the help of [internet], we can see the whole world. It
                  helps us know the economy, education, culture, technology and
                  sports of the world. Using [internet], we can send messages,
                  play games, communicate to anyone to any distant places. We
                  can be aware of different news and views, and can do many
                  other activities. <br />
                  But there is no unmixed blessing on the earth. [Internet] has
                  still some drawbacks in disguise. Using [internet] can cause
                  many diseases to the user. Terrorist are using it to spread

                  of the young generation. Our young generation are led to go
                  astray by this obscenity. <br />
                  it should be our morality to accept the good and give up the
                  bad. And the government should create public awareness.
                  However, [internet] is an indispensable part of our modern

                  greenhouse effect is the process by which certain gases in

                  warm enough to support life. Environmental pollution

                  For healthy living, the main elements of the environment such
                  as air, water and soil, should be free from pollution. But
                  when the balance of these elements is hampered, it is called
                  environmental pollution. <br />
                  This pollution is a great threat to our existence. They cause
                  various human diseases. These diseases may lead a man to
                  death. It changes the world's climate and increases
                  temperature. This reduces human capacity to work. It also
                  causes natural disasters like cyclones. This temperature will
                  melt polar ice-caps and sea levels will increase. As a result,
                  coastal areas will go under water.
                  <br />
                  Thus the world is getting unsuitable for living. So, to make
                  life healthy and comfortable, we should keep the environment
                  clean and pollution free. <br />

                  In both cases, knowledge comes from a journey. We can travel

                  in Bangladesh. I like this journey very much. Now I will
                  describe such a [journey]. It was a historical place named
                  Paharpur, a remote village from Naogaon district. <br />
                  During the summer vacation, we arranged this [study tour] by
                  [bus]. We took enough food and fruit with us. Early in the
                  morning, we had started our journey. It was a sunny day. While
                  passing through, we were glad to see the beautiful scenery of
                  the rural areas. On both sides, we saw green fields of paddy,
                  jute, and plants. We were caught by the natural beauty. But
                  after reaching there, we were really overwhelmed by the beauty
                  of the relics of Buddha Vihar. It was built about seven
                  hundred years ago. It reminds us of the maxim, "seeing is
                  believing."
                  <br />
                  Without traveling, education remains incomplete and imperfect.
                  Traveling removes boredom and offers pleasure. So, we should
                  take traveling and tours.

                  and other services. Thus, I want to serve the nation through
                  my profession.
                  <br />
                  Everyone should continue to work according to his future
                  [plan]. To reach my goal, I am also preparing well in all
                  subjects. After completing my [MBBS], I will start executing
                  my [plain].
                  <br />
                  Success in life depends much on the [plain] of life, and my
                  choice is a noble one. I believe that I will be able to
                  achieve it. Let me know if there's anything else you need!

                <strong>Answer: </strong>
                Ours is a developing country. We have no enough riches. So, (NP)
                is a very great national problem. It has a top negative effect
                on every person in our society and country. It baffles the
                normal development programme. It has on positive side. The
                nations who have avoided it have made more development.
                <br />
                (NP) waste the valuable time and properties on the other hand
                spend more to be normal. Many reasons are behind it. The
                unconsciousness of the people and the government is the main.
                Again some natural and human negative acts cause this type of
                problem. The (NP) is among them. At this the government and the
                general people are to suffer a lot.
                <br />
                We can not expect and ensure a better and comfortable life. We
                are to depend on others. So to ensure happy life, such acts must
                be checked. All the people of the country should come forward to
                stop and uproot it. But the government should take emergency and
                proper step to protect it.

                    <strong>Answer: </strong>There are various noble qualities
                    which separate a good man from a bad man. It is one of them.
                    It is a great virtue. The man who possesses this quality is
                    the luckiest person. To be (it) in one's behavior costs him
                    nothing. Rather it brings much benefit. It indicates that he
                    is a well- bred man and no one find any reason to hate him.
                    <br />
                    It implies obedience to a set of rules for an orderly life
                    in society and stands for a code of conduct, which conforms
                    to the norms of etiquette that weave a behavior pattern
                    which is becoming of a gentleman. Thus it will have to be
                    cultivated in one's character from an early age. Though it
                    does not call for any pecuniary expenditure, it earns a
                    great dividend. A man who is devoid of (it) catches trouble
                    at every step and makes a misery of his life.On the other
                    hand one who has added (it) to his conduct can shine in life
                    and is loved by every individual of society. He can get on
                    smoothly and easily through the thick and thin of life.
                    <br />
                    So, though (it) is a mental faculty and invincible its
                    effect is greatly felt. It is necessary in every walk of
                    life. Man is a social being. In society, he can not do
                    whatever he likes to do. He has to abide by some rules to
                    have peace in society. (It) is one of them. Without (it)
                    chaos will prevail everywhere. It is also key to success in
                    human life. If we make a list of successful persons we will
                    find their success mainly depend upon this great value.
                    Binding it, they not only made their life fruitful but also
                    helped in the advancement of civilization. So the value of
                    it is equally retain every sphere of our life. It is one of
                    the best virtues of mankind and absence of it makes a man
                    unhappy and forlorn. In fact it is more valuable than money.
                    One may have vast property but he is hated only for the
                    absence of it. So wealth is not the only means of happiness
                    in life. The ignorant only follow the other way. Without it,
                    peace and happiness in life is impossible. It is therefor
                    the most precious possession of a man.
                    <br />
                    (It) is seldom an inborn virtue. It should be acquired by
                    force of practice. The children should be taught (it) from
                    the very beginning of life. Without it, there can be no
                    progress, no peace, happiness and no success. In a word
                    those who have risen in their respective vocation have done
                    so simple by dint of it. Therefore we should possess this
                    invaluable virtue which cannot be reckoned in terms of
                    monetary value.
