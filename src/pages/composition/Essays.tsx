                Thanks to science which has changed the world of Adam and Eve by
                its amazing modern technologies. [Mobile phone, internet] are
                some of them. We cannot think of modern life without the gift of
                modern [technology] (like mobile phone).
                <br />
                With the help of [internet], we can see the whole world. It
                helps us know the economy, education, culture, technology and
                sports of the world. Using [internet], we can send messages,
                play games, communicate to anyone to any distant places. We can
                be aware of different news and views, and can do many other

                But there is no unmixed blessing on the earth. [Internet] has
                still some drawbacks in disguise. Using [internet] can cause
                many diseases to the user. Terrorist are using it to spread

                of the young generation. Our young generation are led to go
                astray by this obscenity. <br />
                it should be our morality to accept the good and give up the
                bad. And the government should create public awareness. However,
                [internet] is an indispensable part of our modern life and

                <strong>Answer: </strong>The main cause of ... is carbon
                dioxide(CO2), CFC, methane gasses which are caused by
                environment pollution. For healthy living, the main elements of
                environment such as air, water and soil, should be free from
                pollution. But when the balance of these elements hampered, it
                is called environment pollution.
                <br />
                water is polluted from industrial waste and from chemical
                fertilizer, insecticides used by farmer. Water pollution causes
                various water born disease like cholera, dhiaria . These
                diseases may lead a man to death
                <br />
                Air is polluted by smoke and gases from mill, factories,
                vehicles and by burning trash. Air pollution causes various
                respiratory human disease like asthma, pneumonia, bronchitis.
                These diseases may lead a man to death
                <br />
                These pollutions are a great threat to our existence. They cause
                various human diseases. These diseases may lead a man to death.
                It changes world’s climate and increase temperature. This
                reduces human capacity to work. It also causes natural disasters
                like cyclone.
                <br />
                Thus the world is getting unsuitable for living. So, to make
                life healthy and comfortable, we should keep the environment
                clean and pollution free.

                Greenhosue Effect: The greenhouse effect is the natural process
                by which certain gases in Earth's atmosphere, like carbon
                dioxide and methane, trap heat from the Sun, keeping the planet
                warm enough to support life. However, human activities have
                intensified this effect by increasing greenhouse gas
                concentrations, leading to global warming and climate change.

                <strong>Answer: </strong> Education is not only confined to
                reading books but earning knowledge practically. In this sense,
                [traveling] is very important. By traveling, we earn experience

                In both cases, knowledge comes from a journey. We can travel by
                bus, train, boat, etc. it is cheaper and more comfortable in
                Bangladesh. I like this journey very much. Now I will describe
                such a [journey]. It was a historical place named Paharpur, a
                remote village from Naogaon district. <br />
                During the summer vacation, we arranged this [study tour] by
                [bus]. We took enough food and fruit with us. Early in the
                morning, we had started our journey. It was a sunny day. While
                passing through, we were glad to see the beautiful scenery of
                the rural areas. On both sides, we saw green fields of paddy,
                jute, and plants. We were caught by the natural beauty. But
                after reaching there, we were really overwhelmed by the beauty
                of the relics of Buddha Vihar. It was built about seven hundred
                years ago. It reminds us of the maxim, "seeing is believing."

                Without traveling, education remains incomplete and imperfect.
                Traveling removes boredom and offers pleasure. So, we should

          very great national problem. It has a top negative effect on every
          person in our society and country. It baffles the normal development
          programme. It has on positive side. The nations who have avoided it
          have made more development.

          (NP) waste the valuable time and properties on the other hand spend
          more to be normal. Many reasons are behind it. The unconsciousness of
          the people and the government is the main. Again some natural and
          human negative acts cause this type of problem. The (NP) is among
          them. At this the government and the general people are to suffer a
          lot.
          <br />
          We can not expect and ensure a better and comfortable life. We are to
          depend on others. So to ensure happy life, such acts must be checked.
          All the people of the country should come forward to stop and uproot
          it. But the government should take emergency and proper step to
          protect it.

          <p className="text-start">
            <strong>Answer: </strong>There are various noble qualities which
            seperate a good man from a bad man. It is one of them. It is a great
            virtue. The man who possesses this quality is the luckiest person.
            To be (it) in one's behavior costs him nothing. Rather it brings
            much benefit. It indicates that he is a well- bred man and no one
            find any reason to hate him.
            <br />
            It implies obedience to a set of rules for an orderly life in
            society and stands for a code of conduct, which conforms to the
            norms of etiquette that weave a behavior pattern which is becoming
            of a gentleman. Thus it will have to be cultivated in one's
            character from an early age. Though it does not call for any
            pecuniary expenditure, it earns a great dividend. A man who is
            devoid of (it) catches trouble at every step and makes a misery of
            his life.On the other hand one who has added (it) to his conduct can
            shine in life and is loved by every individual of society. He can
            get on smoothly and easily through the thick and thin of life.
            <br />
            So, though (it) is a mental faculty and invincible its effect is
            greatly felt. It is necessary in every walk of life. Man is a social
            being. In society, he can not do whatever he likes to do. He has to
            abide by some rules to have peace in society. (It) is one of them.
            Without (it) chaos will prevail everywhere. It is also key to
            success in human life. If we make a list of successful persons we
            will find their success mainly depend upon this great value. Binding
            it, they not only made their life fruitful but also helped in the
            advancement of civilization. So the value of it is equally retain
            every sphere of our life. It is one of the best virtues of mankind
            and absence of it makes a man unhappy and forlorn. In fact it is
            more valuable than money. One may have vast property but he is hated
            only for the absence of it. So wealth is not the only means of
            happiness in life. The ignorant only follow the other way. Without
            it, peace and happiness in life is impossible. It is therefor the
            most precious possession of a man.
            <br />
            (It) is seldom an inborn virtue. It should be acquired by force of
            practice. The children should be taught (it) from the very beginning
            of life. Without it, there can be no progress, no peace, happiness
            and no success. In a word those who have risen in their respective
            vocation have done so simple by dint of it. Therefore we should
            possess this invaluable virtue which cannot be reckoned in terms of
            monetary value.
