        1. Read the passage and then write the antonym or synonym of the words
        as directed below. <br />
        <br />
        Sports are a popular form of entertainment. Many international sporting
        events are organized from time to time. Most of the events are sponsored
        by multinational manufacturing companies and business firms. They pay
        for the sports events in exchange for the right to advertise their
        products during those events. These events are telecast worldwide by
        satellite and people all over the world watch them live. As a result,
        the sponsors’ products receive maximum media coverage giving companies
        international recognition. This is the only commercial aspect of
        international sport but there are other aspects too.

        as directed below. <br />
        The process of globalization obviously requires a common language for
        international communication. For many different reasons, English has
        achieved the prestige of being that language. As a result, it has
        crossed national borders to reach people who speak other languages. It
        is no longer the unique possession of British or American people, but a
        language that belongs to the world’s people. In fact, bilingual and
        multilingual users of English far outnumber its monolingual native
        speakers. This phenomenon has led to a bewildering variety of English
        around the world. As more and more people speak English, more and more
        varieties have emerged which are strongly influenced by the
        pronunciation, grammar and idioms of the respective mother-tongues.
        World English has now moved away from the control of the native
        speakers. However, the question of British or American English is not so
        important now. Today’s slogan is mutual intelligibility among users of
        the language. <br />

        3. Read the passage and then write the antonym or synonym of the words
        as directed below. Sincerity is the root of success of all works. One
        can go a long way if he does a job with sincerity. The great men are
        sincere because they know that sincerity is the key to success. Those
        who do not follow the rules of sincerity can never go a long way.
        Sincerity is the secret of victory. If any work is not done with
        sincerity, one will never receive desirable output from it. So we should
        be sincere in every walk of life. <br />

        There are many people who have a conservative outlook. Quite early in

        After the flight of Yuri Gagarin, the first human being to travel to
        outer space in 1961, the Soviet Union decided to send a woman in space.
        Proletarian Valentina Tereshkova was selected for this project from
        among more than four hundred applicants. Since the successful launch of
        the spacecraft Vostok-5 on 14 June 1963, Tereshkova began preparing for
        her own flight. On 16 June 1963, she was dressed in space-suits and
        taken to the space shuttle launch pad by a bus. After completing her
        communication and life support checks, she was sealed inside Vostok-6.
        Finishing a two-hour countdown, Vostok-6 launched faultlessly. Although
        Tereshkova experienced nausea and physical discomfort for much of the
        flight, she orbited the earth 48 times and spent almost three days in
        space. She also maintained a flight log and took photographs of the
        horizon, which were later used to identify aerosol layers within the
        atmosphere. <br />
