                    1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B.
                  </p>
                  Once upon a time there lived a bird. It was unlettered. It
                  sang but couldn't recite a word of scripture. hopped and it
                  flew but lacked all sense of manners. <br />
                  The King said, "Such a bird is of no use. Yet it devours fruit
                  from the forest, bringing down the profits of fruiterers in
                  the royal market." <br />
                  He summoned the Minister and commanded, "Educate the bird!"{" "}
                  <br />
                  The task of educating the bird fell on the King's nephews, his
                  sisters' sons. The learned men of the court deliberated long.
                  They pondered the reasons behind the ignorance of the creature
                  in question. The conclusion: the bird's nest made of straw and
                  twigs could not hold much knowledge. Therefore, the first
                  thing needed was a proper cage. <br />
                  The royal scholars received handsome fees and happily went
                  home. A goldsmith set to work on a gilded cage. It turned out
                  to be of such exquisite workmanship that people from far and
                  near crowded round for a look. Some said, "This is education
                  par excellence." Others said, "Even if it learns nothing, it
                  has got the cage. What a lucky bird." The goldsmith was
                  delighted to get a bagful of money as reward and went home at
                  once. <br />
                  A teacher came to give lessons to the bird. He took a pinch of
                  snuff and declared, "This isn't a matter of just a few texts."
                  One of the royal nephews sent for scribes. They made multiple
                  copies of various texts until there was a veritable mountain.
                  "Bravol" exclaimed those who saw it, "There is no room for any
                  more knowledge." The scribes loaded their wages onto bullocks
                  and merrily headed home. They would never again want for
                  anything. <br />
                  The nephews were constantly busy looking after the expensive
                  cage. Repairs were always under way. Anyone who saw the
                  endless dusting, wiping and polishing had to agree that there
                  was "marked Improvement". <br />
                  A large maintenance crew was needed, and more personnel to
                  supervise them. They all got handsome monthly salaries, which
                  they saved in their wooden chests. Even their cousins came to
                  live with them in cushioned comfort. <br />

                  The orphanage is high in the Carolina mountains. I was there
                  in the autumn. I wanted quiet, isolation, to do some
                  troublesome writing. I wanted mountain air to blow out the
                  malaria from too long a time in the subtropics. I was homesick
                  too, for the flaming of maples in October, and for corn shocks
                  and pumpkins and black-walnut trees.... I found them all
                  living in a cabin that belonged to the orphanage, half a mile
                  beyond the orphanage farm. When I took the cabin, I asked a
                  boy or man to come and chop wood for the fireplace.... <br />
                  door and I looked up from my typewriter one late afternoon, a
                  little startled. A boy stood at the pointer dog, my companion,
                  was at his side and had not barked to warn me. The boy was
                  probably twelve years old, but undersized. He wore overalls
                  and a torn shirt, and was barefooted. <br />

                1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionise the
                way we learn and teach. As a tool in the classroom, Al can
                provide students with personalised learning experiences,
                automate repetitive tasks and provide instant feedback. However,
                it also has its limitations. Let us explore the pros and cons of
                Al as a tool in the classroom, address the concern that Al could
                be a threat to teachers' and Instructors' Jobs and discuss the
                role of edtech companies in advancing this Al use case. <br />
                Advantages of Al in the Classroom <br />
                One of the main advantages I see of Al in the classroom is
                personalised learning. Al-powered educational tools can analyse
                data on student performance and provide tailored support to
                improve their grades. <br />
                Al can also provide Instant feedback. For example, Al-powered
                educational tools can provide students with immediate feedback
                on their work, allowing them to identify and correct mistakes
                quickly. <br />
                Another advantage of Al is its ability to automate repetitive
                tasks. It can grade assignments and quizzes, which can free up
                teachers' time for other tasks, such as lesson planning and
                providing more one-on-one attention to students. <br />
                There are already a few Al tools that support learning in
                classroom or workplace contexts. For example, Ahura is an
                Al-powered learning assistant that tracks learning habits by
                observing attention and engagement. Knewton offers an adaptive
                learning platform that provides personalized learning
                experiences for students. Querium is an Al-powered tutor that
                provides students with step-by-step tutoring on math problems
                and builds personalized lesson plans. ALEKS is an Al-powered
                learning platform that provides individualized learning paths
                based on students' strengths and weaknesses. Carnegie Learning
                offers an Al-powered tutor that helps students improve their
                math skills by providing personalised learning based on their
                performance. There's also Smart Sparrow, which allows users to
                provide constructive feedback that is unique to each Student.{" "}
                <br />
                Finally, Gradescope is an Al-powered grading tool that automates
                the grading process, which can free up teachers' time and allow
                them to provide more individualised attention to students. These
                are just a few examples of Al tools with applications in the
                classroom. It is important to note that these tools should not
                replace teachers but rather assist them in their work. <br />

                Varaha's activity. (one is done for you) 2x 5= 10 <br />
                There are many versions of Khona's story. One retelling goes
                like this: in the kingdom of Deyulnagar, there was a royal
                astrologer named Varaha who served King Dharmaketu. Sadly,
                Varaha's wife died while giving birth to their son, Mihir.{" "}
                <br />
                Worried about his son's future, Varaha saw in the stars that
                Mihir was defined for a life of trouble and death. Heartbroken,
                Varaha decided to save Mihir by placing him in a copper pot and
                setting the pot afloat on the river Viddyadhory. The baby was
                found and rescued in Sri Lanka, where he was raised by the king.
                As he grew up in the royal court, he married the king's
                daughter, an astrologer herself, named Lila. <br />
                Lila and Mihir managed to find Varaha and prove that his
                predictions about Mihir's future had been wrong. Varaha, though
                surprised by his mistake, was thrilled to see his son again and
                welcomed both Mihir and Lila warmly. They were soon introduced
                to the royal court and became royal astrologers themselves. vinu
                divor <br />
                <br />
                Even though Lila was now a royal astrologer, she kept in touch
                with the local farmers. She learned a lot from them and found
                that they shared valuable knowledge through short,
                easy-to-remember verses. Lila began to use these simple verses
                to explain her own complex astrological knowledge. Varaha,
                feeling jealous and angry, ordered his son to punish Lila by
                cutting out her tongue, hoping to silence her. However, Khona's
                story and her knowledge remained alive. Her wisdom about
                nature-oriented farming continued to benefit the people of the
                land.[Unit-3; Lesson-4(B)) <br />

                1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                Education aims to bring about positive changes in our behavior.
                It helps us try to change our lives as well as the society we
                live in. Education that does not illuminate our minds or does
                not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all.
                Education is not all about getting grades or receiving
                certificates we use education to make life better. We are
                expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn
                in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies
                outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a
                look at how education works. <br />
                Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the
                world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in
                the civic life (the public life of the citizens as contrasted
                with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge,
                skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the
                quality of life in a community by contributing to the
                improvement of health and wellbeing of the people. Civically
                engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger
                social community and are concerned about civic issues. They
                consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or
                raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other
                forms of social ills. <br />
                In civic engagement, Issues of public concern are crucial. Civic
                engagement includes individual or group activities to protect
                public interests and change the way the community values itself.
                For example, if you are protesting against any unjust decision
                of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that
                might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged
                and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest
                can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies.
                collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions,
                etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school,
                help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park
                or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly
                people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you
                do directly affects the community. <br />
                When civic engagement is a part of an academic programme, and
                the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it
                is called service learning. It involves the application of
                knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a
                complete plan of action i.e. preparing a budget, starting the
                process of implementation, involving people and activating
                operational strategies. When civic engagement is spontaneous but
                irregular and not a part of any academic programme, it is
                considered volunteerism. <br /> [Unit-1: Lesson-4(C)] <br />

                The July Uprising was a mass movement in Bangladesh that led to
                the overthrow of Sheikh Hasina's regime in July-August 2024.
                Also referred to as the 'Monsoon Revolution' or 'July
                Revolution, the movement began with a student-led protest at
                Dhaka University demanding quota reform in public service. The
                government's brutal repression and the tragic loss of life
                transformed the initially apolitical protest into a widespread
                uprising that united various political, cultural, social, and
                religious groups. This collective mobilization ultimately led to
                Sheikh Hasina fleeing the country. The uprising was not a sudden
                event, rather it was the culmination of 16 years of public
                frustration stemming from tyranny, human rights abuses, and the
                systematic dismantling of state institutions. [Unit-4;

                PART-A: READING TEST [60 Marks] <br />
                1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                In Bangladesh folk music has great variety, with songs being
                composed on the culture, festivals, views cial inequality of
                life, natural beauty, rivers and rural and riverine life. These
                songs are also about social and poverty, about the material
                world and the supernatural. Mystical songs have been composed
                using the metaphors of rivers and boats. Since the country is
                basically riverine, the Bhatiyali forms an important genre of
                folk music. Nature plays a role in providing the content and
                rhythm of folk music. <br />
                The folk music of Bangladesh varies from region to region
                reflecting changes in the natural environment and the dialects
                people use. Thus there are the northern Bhawalya, the eastern
                Bhatiyall and the southwestern Baul songs. The culture and the
                lifestyle of the different ethnic minorities, such as the
                Chakmas, manipuris, Santals or Tripuris, have also influenced
                fold music. Their interaction with Bengali culture and lifestyle
                over the years has been clearly reflected in the richness of our
                folk music. <br />
                Folk songs may be sung individually or in chorus. Folk songs
                sung individually include Baul. Bhatiyali. Murshidi and Marfati,
                while songs sung in chorus include Kabigan, Leto, Alkap and
                Gambhira. Some songs are regional in character, but others are
                common to both Bangladesh and West Bengal. Similarly, some songs
                belong distinctively to one religious community, the Hindus or
                the Muslims, other cross religious boundaries. Some songs belong
                exclusively to men, others to women, while some are sung by both
                men and women. <br />
                Thus only women compose and sing Bratagan and Meyeli Git, but
                both men and women participate in the old practice of
                'roof-beating songs that are sung while beating down and firming
                rooftops. <br /> [Unir-2: Lesson-2(B)] <br />

                If it rains at the end of Magh (last month of Winter), the
                kingdom will prosper. <br />
                The mystery that connects seasons with soil and crops with rain
                was no secret to her. She realized the interdependence that
                links people and climate in myriad ways. She was Khona. <br />
                The mythical story of Khona is deeply rooted in Bangla folklore.
                Khona, originally named Lila, was an incredible woman with a
                gift for predicting weather and understanding the ways of
                farming. Her wisdom was shared through memorable, rhyming verses
                known as "Khona's Words" or "Khonar Bochon." These sayings,
                though simple and easy to remember, were filled with deep
                knowledge and practical advice for farmers. <br />
                Khona used her knowledge to help the peasants, but her actions
                often challenged the ruling class. The rulers, not pleased with
                her defiance, punished her cruelly by cutting out her tongue.
                Thus, she became known as Khona, which means "someone who cannot
                speak." Despite this harsh punishment, her wisdom lived on
                through her sayings, which have been passed down for over 1500
                years.[Unit-3: Lesson-4(B)] <br />

                1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                Lalon Shah (1774-1890) is best known as an icon of the Baul
                tradition in Bengal, although he was also a philosopher, thinker
                and social reformer. He preached religious tolerance and
                rejected social differences based on class, caste and creed. He
                also believed that a search for truth should begin with the
                body, which reflects the mystery of creation. <br />
                <br />
                Although Lalon's songs are admired for the profound
                philosophical and mystical insights they offer, he did not
                receive any formal education. Not much is known about his early
                life. A popular story about him- which many believe to be true-
                is that while on a pilgrimage to a holy place, Lalon, who was
                born a Hindu, contracted smallpox and was abandoned by his
                companions. A Muslim fakir, Siraj Sain. picked him up and took
                him to his own house where he nursed him back to health. When
                Lalon returned home, his family refused to take him in as he had
                lived in a Muslim household. So Lalon returned to Siraj Sain and
                took up a life of devotion and asceticism under his guidance.
                After the death of Sainji, Lalon set up an akhrah or monastery
                in Chheuriya near Kushtia. It soon attracted admirers and
                mystics in search of salvation who became initiated into Baul
                asceticism and became his disciples. As Lalon began writing and
                composing songs, which his disciples sang with the accompaniment
                of ektara or dotara, his fame spread to faraway places.
                Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam were among those who
                admired him and were influenced by his shahajiya philosophy (the
                attainment of the self through the simple truths that reside in
                one's own body and soul-not outside - which can be reached
                through sadhana or meditation). Many of his disciples also
                became famous for their songs. They included Kangal Harinath
                Majumder, Pagla Kanal and Dudu Shah.[Unit-2; Lesson-2(F)] <br />

                Once upon a time there lived a bird. It was unlettered. It sang
                but couldn't recite a word of scripture. It hopped and it flew
                but lacked all sense of manners. <br />
                The King said, "Such a bird is of no use. Yet it devours fruit
                from the forest, bringing down the profits of fruiterers in the
                royal market." <br />
                He summoned the Minister and commanded, "Educate the bird!"{" "}
                <br />
                The task of educating the bird fell on the King's nephews, his
                sisters' sons. <br />
                The learned men of the court deliberated long. They pondered the
                reasons behind the ignorance of the creature in question. The
                conclusion: the bird's nest made of straw and twigs could not
                hold much knowledge. Therefore, the first thing needed was a
                proper cage. <br />
                The royal scholars received handsome fees and happily went home.{" "}

                1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                Art is generally understood as an expression of human
                Imagination and creative skills in a range of activities
                including painting, drawing, sculpture and architecture. The aim
                of art is to evoke feelings and emotions that are considered
                aesthetic- that is, concerned with beauty- but art also can be a
                form of social commentary. A painting of sunset over the sea
                glorifies nature, but one that shows a war ravaged town can
                convey a sense of anguish. Throughout the world people
                appreciate art for its power to affect them in creative ways. As
                the famous painter Pablo Picasso said, "the purpose of art is
                washing the dust of daily life off our souls." <br />
                Art in our country has a long history. It has been practiced in
                households in the form of pottery. nakshikantha or embroidered
                quilt, alpana or intricate, mostly floral designs in rice paste
                done on clay yards and shokher harhi or painted earthen pots
                (and their lids). These are examples of folk art. But there is
                another form of art which is called modern art, which owes its
                origin to the industrial revolution in Western Europe in the
                middle of-19th century and the changes it brought in technology.
                education, manufacturing and communication. Modern art rejected
                traditional art forms and began to create new types of artistic
                expression using styles, techniques, colours and materials that
                could adequately reflect the spirit of the time and the profound
                changes in human thought. (Unit-2: Lesson-3(B)) <br />

                She could tell him about the dress she was wearing that day.
                Mother made most of her dresses, but this one came from a shop.
                Her clothes were always torn when she came home in the late
                afternoon. Some of the rips were quite bad. Mother never knew
                how they got that way. Even her white cotton panties were
                sometimes in shreds. She explained to the headmaster that they
                got torn when she crossed other people's gardens by crawling
                under their fences, and when she burrowed under the barbed wire
                around vacant lots. So this morning, she said, when she was
                getting dressed to come here, all the nice dresses Mother had
                made were torn so she had to wear one Mother had bought. It had
                small dark red and gray checks and was made of jersey, and it
                wasn't bad, but Mother thought the red flowers embroidered on
                the collar were in bad taste. <br />
                <br />
                "Mother doesn't like the collar," said Totto-chan, holding it up
                for the headmaster to see. After that, she could think of
                nothing more to say no matter how hard she tried. It made her
                rather sad. But just then the headmaster got up, placed his
                large, warm hand on her head, and said, "Well, now you're a
                pupil of this school." <br />

                1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                Sheikh Mohammed Sultan, widely known as SM Sultan, was a
                distinguished Bangladeshi painter renowned for his distinctive
                personal and artistic style. Born on August 10, 1923, in
                Jessore, Bangladesh. Sultan is often remembered as a bohemian
                artist who traveled extensively. Despite his unique vision, he
                only achieved widespread recognition later in life. His work was
                first showcased in Dhaka in 1976, and a significant
                retrospective organized by the Goethe Institute, Dhaka in 1987
                solidified his status as a major artist. Despite coming from an
                underprivileged background, SM Sultan made his mark in the art
                world through sheer passion and his ability to build enduring
                connections. Although his family could not afford his education
                at the Calcutta School of Arts, he received a special
                recommendation that allowed him to study there for three years.{" "}
                <br />
                His very simple but highly philosophic art, which affected
                nature and the people of Bangladesh, has become the prime source
                of inspiration for the new generation of painters. Sultan's
                characters were farmers, rural women, children, animals, and
                even pets. The main feature of his paintings is the muscular
                farmers. with extensive muscles and godly physical stature which
                make his farmers larger than life. Sultan took little care of
                his finished works, and many are lost. He was unconcerned about
                using materials that would preserve. Sultan's song was never
                about a legacy of artwork but of ideas. <br />
                Apart from being awarded prestigious awards, accolades, and
                being featured in top art institutions. Sultan received wide
                press coverage and laudatory critical reviews in renowned
                newspapers like the New York Times, Washington Post, The
                Telegraph. The Times. The Guardian, Le Monde, and many more. He
                became internationally acclaimed as a great painter of classic
                dimensions. Sultan received the Ekushey Padak, Swadhinata Padak,
                Bangladesh Charu Shilpi Sangsad Padak, and other prestigious
                awards! <br />

                2. Based on your reading of the passage, make short notes in
                each of the boxes in the flow-chart <br />
                showing the parentage of Frederick Douglass. (No. 1 has been
                done for you.) 2×5=10 My father was a white man. He was admitted
                to be such by all I ever heard speak of my parentage. <br />
                The opinion was also whispered that my master was my father, but
                of the correctness of this opinion. I know nothing the means of
                knowing was withheld from me. My mother and I were separated
                when I was but an infant - before I knew her as my mother. It is
                a common custom. In the part of Maryland from which I ran away,
                to part children from their mothers at a very early age.
                Frequently, before the child has reached its twelfth month, its
                mother is taken from it, and hired out on some farm a
                considerable distance off. and the child is placed under the
                care of an old woman. too old for field labor. For what this
                separation is done, I do not know, unless it is to hinder the
                development of the child's affection toward its mother, and to
                blunt and destroy the natural affection of the mother for the
                child. This is the inevitable result. <br />
                I never saw my mother, to know her as such, more than four or
                five times in my life; and each of these times was very short in
                duration, and at night. She was hired by a Mr. Stewart, who
                lived about twelve miles from my home. She made her journeys to
                see me in the night, travelling the whole distance on foot,
                after the performance of her day's work. She was a field hand,
                and a whipping is the penalty of not being in the field at
                sunrise, unless a slave has special permission from his or her
                master to the contrary--a permission which they seldom get, and
                one that gives to him that gives it the proud name of being a
                kind master. I do not recollect of ever seeing my mother by the
                light of day. She was with me in the night. She would lie down
                with me, and get me to sleep, but long before I waked she was
                gone. Very little communication ever took place between us.
                Death soon ended what little we could have while she lived, and
                with it her hardships and suffering. She died when I was about
                seven years old, on one of my maker's farms, near Lee's Mill. I
                was not allowed to be present during her illness, at her death,
                or burial. <br />
                She was gone long before I knew anything about it. Never having
                enjoyed, to any considerable extent, her soothing presence, her
                tender and watchful care, I received the tidings of her death
                with much the same emotions I should have probably felt at the
                death of a stranger. <br /> [Unit-8: Lesson-5(BJ)] <br />
