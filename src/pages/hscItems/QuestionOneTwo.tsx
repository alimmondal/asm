                    1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B.
                  </p>
                  Once upon a time there lived a bird. It was unlettered. It
                  sang but couldn't recite a word of scripture. hopped and it
                  flew but lacked all sense of manners. <br />
                  The King said, "Such a bird is of no use. Yet it devours fruit
                  from the forest, bringing down the profits of fruiterers in
                  the royal market." <br />
                  He summoned the Minister and commanded, "Educate the bird!"{" "}
                  <br />
                  The task of educating the bird fell on the King's nephews, his
                  sisters' sons. The learned men of the court deliberated long.
                  They pondered the reasons behind the ignorance of the creature
                  in question. The conclusion: the bird's nest made of straw and
                  twigs could not hold much knowledge. Therefore, the first
                  thing needed was a proper cage. <br />
                  The royal scholars received handsome fees and happily went
                  home. A goldsmith set to work on a gilded cage. It turned out
                  to be of such exquisite workmanship that people from far and
                  near crowded round for a look. Some said, "This is education
                  par excellence." Others said, "Even if it learns nothing, it
                  has got the cage. What a lucky bird." The goldsmith was
                  delighted to get a bagful of money as reward and went home at
                  once. <br />
                  A teacher came to give lessons to the bird. He took a pinch of
                  snuff and declared, "This isn't a matter of just a few texts."
                  One of the royal nephews sent for scribes. They made multiple
                  copies of various texts until there was a veritable mountain.
                  "Bravol" exclaimed those who saw it, "There is no room for any
                  more knowledge." The scribes loaded their wages onto bullocks
                  and merrily headed home. They would never again want for
                  anything. <br />
                  The nephews were constantly busy looking after the expensive
                  cage. Repairs were always under way. Anyone who saw the
                  endless dusting, wiping and polishing had to agree that there
                  was "marked Improvement". <br />
                  A large maintenance crew was needed, and more personnel to
                  supervise them. They all got handsome monthly salaries, which
                  they saved in their wooden chests. Even their cousins came to
                  live with them in cushioned comfort. <br />

                  The orphanage is high in the Carolina mountains. I was there
                  in the autumn. I wanted quiet, isolation, to do some
                  troublesome writing. I wanted mountain air to blow out the
                  malaria from too long a time in the subtropics. I was homesick
                  too, for the flaming of maples in October, and for corn shocks
                  and pumpkins and black-walnut trees.... I found them all
                  living in a cabin that belonged to the orphanage, half a mile
                  beyond the orphanage farm. When I took the cabin, I asked a
                  boy or man to come and chop wood for the fireplace.... <br />
                  door and I looked up from my typewriter one late afternoon, a
                  little startled. A boy stood at the pointer dog, my companion,
                  was at his side and had not barked to warn me. The boy was
                  probably twelve years old, but undersized. He wore overalls
                  and a torn shirt, and was barefooted. <br />

                1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionise the
                way we learn and teach. As a tool in the classroom, Al can
                provide students with personalised learning experiences,
                automate repetitive tasks and provide instant feedback. However,
                it also has its limitations. Let us explore the pros and cons of
                Al as a tool in the classroom, address the concern that Al could
                be a threat to teachers' and Instructors' Jobs and discuss the
                role of edtech companies in advancing this Al use case. <br />
                Advantages of Al in the Classroom <br />
                One of the main advantages I see of Al in the classroom is
                personalised learning. Al-powered educational tools can analyse
                data on student performance and provide tailored support to
                improve their grades. <br />
                Al can also provide Instant feedback. For example, Al-powered
                educational tools can provide students with immediate feedback
                on their work, allowing them to identify and correct mistakes
                quickly. <br />
                Another advantage of Al is its ability to automate repetitive
                tasks. It can grade assignments and quizzes, which can free up
                teachers' time for other tasks, such as lesson planning and
                providing more one-on-one attention to students. <br />
                There are already a few Al tools that support learning in
                classroom or workplace contexts. For example, Ahura is an
                Al-powered learning assistant that tracks learning habits by
                observing attention and engagement. Knewton offers an adaptive
                learning platform that provides personalized learning
                experiences for students. Querium is an Al-powered tutor that
                provides students with step-by-step tutoring on math problems
                and builds personalized lesson plans. ALEKS is an Al-powered
                learning platform that provides individualized learning paths
                based on students' strengths and weaknesses. Carnegie Learning
                offers an Al-powered tutor that helps students improve their
                math skills by providing personalised learning based on their
                performance. There's also Smart Sparrow, which allows users to
                provide constructive feedback that is unique to each Student.{" "}
                <br />
                Finally, Gradescope is an Al-powered grading tool that automates
                the grading process, which can free up teachers' time and allow
                them to provide more individualised attention to students. These
                are just a few examples of Al tools with applications in the
                classroom. It is important to note that these tools should not
                replace teachers but rather assist them in their work. <br />

                Varaha's activity. (one is done for you) 2x 5= 10 <br />
                There are many versions of Khona's story. One retelling goes
                like this: in the kingdom of Deyulnagar, there was a royal
                astrologer named Varaha who served King Dharmaketu. Sadly,
                Varaha's wife died while giving birth to their son, Mihir.{" "}
                <br />
                Worried about his son's future, Varaha saw in the stars that
                Mihir was defined for a life of trouble and death. Heartbroken,
                Varaha decided to save Mihir by placing him in a copper pot and
                setting the pot afloat on the river Viddyadhory. The baby was
                found and rescued in Sri Lanka, where he was raised by the king.
                As he grew up in the royal court, he married the king's
                daughter, an astrologer herself, named Lila. <br />
                Lila and Mihir managed to find Varaha and prove that his
                predictions about Mihir's future had been wrong. Varaha, though
                surprised by his mistake, was thrilled to see his son again and
                welcomed both Mihir and Lila warmly. They were soon introduced
                to the royal court and became royal astrologers themselves. vinu
                divor <br />
                <br />
                Even though Lila was now a royal astrologer, she kept in touch
                with the local farmers. She learned a lot from them and found
                that they shared valuable knowledge through short,
                easy-to-remember verses. Lila began to use these simple verses
                to explain her own complex astrological knowledge. Varaha,
                feeling jealous and angry, ordered his son to punish Lila by
                cutting out her tongue, hoping to silence her. However, Khona's
                story and her knowledge remained alive. Her wisdom about
                nature-oriented farming continued to benefit the people of the
                land.[Unit-3; Lesson-4(B)) <br />

                1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                Education aims to bring about positive changes in our behavior.
                It helps us try to change our lives as well as the society we
                live in. Education that does not illuminate our minds or does
                not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all.
                Education is not all about getting grades or receiving
                certificates we use education to make life better. We are
                expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn
                in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies
                outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a
                look at how education works. <br />
                Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the
                world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in
                the civic life (the public life of the citizens as contrasted
                with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge,
                skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the
                quality of life in a community by contributing to the
                improvement of health and wellbeing of the people. Civically
                engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger
                social community and are concerned about civic issues. They
                consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or
                raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other
                forms of social ills. <br />
                In civic engagement, Issues of public concern are crucial. Civic
                engagement includes individual or group activities to protect
                public interests and change the way the community values itself.
                For example, if you are protesting against any unjust decision
                of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that
                might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged
                and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest
                can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies.
                collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions,
                etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school,
                help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park
                or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly
                people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you
                do directly affects the community. <br />
                When civic engagement is a part of an academic programme, and
                the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it
                is called service learning. It involves the application of
                knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a
                complete plan of action i.e. preparing a budget, starting the
                process of implementation, involving people and activating
                operational strategies. When civic engagement is spontaneous but
                irregular and not a part of any academic programme, it is
                considered volunteerism. <br /> [Unit-1: Lesson-4(C)] <br />

                The July Uprising was a mass movement in Bangladesh that led to
                the overthrow of Sheikh Hasina's regime in July-August 2024.
                Also referred to as the 'Monsoon Revolution' or 'July
                Revolution, the movement began with a student-led protest at
                Dhaka University demanding quota reform in public service. The
                government's brutal repression and the tragic loss of life
                transformed the initially apolitical protest into a widespread
                uprising that united various political, cultural, social, and
                religious groups. This collective mobilization ultimately led to
                Sheikh Hasina fleeing the country. The uprising was not a sudden
                event, rather it was the culmination of 16 years of public
                frustration stemming from tyranny, human rights abuses, and the
                systematic dismantling of state institutions. [Unit-4;

                PART-A: READING TEST [60 Marks] <br />
                1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                In Bangladesh folk music has great variety, with songs being
                composed on the culture, festivals, views cial inequality of
                life, natural beauty, rivers and rural and riverine life. These
                songs are also about social and poverty, about the material
                world and the supernatural. Mystical songs have been composed
                using the metaphors of rivers and boats. Since the country is
                basically riverine, the Bhatiyali forms an important genre of
                folk music. Nature plays a role in providing the content and
                rhythm of folk music. <br />
                The folk music of Bangladesh varies from region to region
                reflecting changes in the natural environment and the dialects
                people use. Thus there are the northern Bhawalya, the eastern
                Bhatiyall and the southwestern Baul songs. The culture and the
                lifestyle of the different ethnic minorities, such as the
                Chakmas, manipuris, Santals or Tripuris, have also influenced
                fold music. Their interaction with Bengali culture and lifestyle
                over the years has been clearly reflected in the richness of our
                folk music. <br />
                Folk songs may be sung individually or in chorus. Folk songs
                sung individually include Baul. Bhatiyali. Murshidi and Marfati,
                while songs sung in chorus include Kabigan, Leto, Alkap and
                Gambhira. Some songs are regional in character, but others are
                common to both Bangladesh and West Bengal. Similarly, some songs
                belong distinctively to one religious community, the Hindus or
                the Muslims, other cross religious boundaries. Some songs belong
                exclusively to men, others to women, while some are sung by both
                men and women. <br />
                Thus only women compose and sing Bratagan and Meyeli Git, but
                both men and women participate in the old practice of
                'roof-beating songs that are sung while beating down and firming
                rooftops. <br /> [Unir-2: Lesson-2(B)] <br />

                If it rains at the end of Magh (last month of Winter), the
                kingdom will prosper. <br />
                The mystery that connects seasons with soil and crops with rain
                was no secret to her. She realized the interdependence that
                links people and climate in myriad ways. She was Khona. <br />
                The mythical story of Khona is deeply rooted in Bangla folklore.
                Khona, originally named Lila, was an incredible woman with a
                gift for predicting weather and understanding the ways of
                farming. Her wisdom was shared through memorable, rhyming verses
                known as "Khona's Words" or "Khonar Bochon." These sayings,
                though simple and easy to remember, were filled with deep
                knowledge and practical advice for farmers. <br />
                Khona used her knowledge to help the peasants, but her actions
                often challenged the ruling class. The rulers, not pleased with
                her defiance, punished her cruelly by cutting out her tongue.
                Thus, she became known as Khona, which means "someone who cannot
                speak." Despite this harsh punishment, her wisdom lived on
                through her sayings, which have been passed down for over 1500
                years.[Unit-3: Lesson-4(B)] <br />

                1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                Lalon Shah (1774-1890) is best known as an icon of the Baul
                tradition in Bengal, although he was also a philosopher, thinker
                and social reformer. He preached religious tolerance and
                rejected social differences based on class, caste and creed. He
                also believed that a search for truth should begin with the
                body, which reflects the mystery of creation. <br />
                <br />
                Although Lalon's songs are admired for the profound
                philosophical and mystical insights they offer, he did not
                receive any formal education. Not much is known about his early
                life. A popular story about him- which many believe to be true-
                is that while on a pilgrimage to a holy place, Lalon, who was
                born a Hindu, contracted smallpox and was abandoned by his
                companions. A Muslim fakir, Siraj Sain. picked him up and took
                him to his own house where he nursed him back to health. When
                Lalon returned home, his family refused to take him in as he had
                lived in a Muslim household. So Lalon returned to Siraj Sain and
                took up a life of devotion and asceticism under his guidance.
                After the death of Sainji, Lalon set up an akhrah or monastery
                in Chheuriya near Kushtia. It soon attracted admirers and
                mystics in search of salvation who became initiated into Baul
                asceticism and became his disciples. As Lalon began writing and
                composing songs, which his disciples sang with the accompaniment
                of ektara or dotara, his fame spread to faraway places.
                Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam were among those who
                admired him and were influenced by his shahajiya philosophy (the
                attainment of the self through the simple truths that reside in
                one's own body and soul-not outside - which can be reached
                through sadhana or meditation). Many of his disciples also
                became famous for their songs. They included Kangal Harinath
                Majumder, Pagla Kanal and Dudu Shah.[Unit-2; Lesson-2(F)] <br />

                Once upon a time there lived a bird. It was unlettered. It sang
                but couldn't recite a word of scripture. It hopped and it flew
                but lacked all sense of manners. <br />
                The King said, "Such a bird is of no use. Yet it devours fruit
                from the forest, bringing down the profits of fruiterers in the
                royal market." <br />
                He summoned the Minister and commanded, "Educate the bird!"{" "}
                <br />
                The task of educating the bird fell on the King's nephews, his
                sisters' sons. <br />
                The learned men of the court deliberated long. They pondered the
                reasons behind the ignorance of the creature in question. The
                conclusion: the bird's nest made of straw and twigs could not
                hold much knowledge. Therefore, the first thing needed was a
                proper cage. <br />
                The royal scholars received handsome fees and happily went home.{" "}

                1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                Art is generally understood as an expression of human
                Imagination and creative skills in a range of activities
                including painting, drawing, sculpture and architecture. The aim
                of art is to evoke feelings and emotions that are considered
                aesthetic- that is, concerned with beauty- but art also can be a
                form of social commentary. A painting of sunset over the sea
                glorifies nature, but one that shows a war ravaged town can
                convey a sense of anguish. Throughout the world people
                appreciate art for its power to affect them in creative ways. As
                the famous painter Pablo Picasso said, "the purpose of art is
                washing the dust of daily life off our souls." <br />
                Art in our country has a long history. It has been practiced in
                households in the form of pottery. nakshikantha or embroidered
                quilt, alpana or intricate, mostly floral designs in rice paste
                done on clay yards and shokher harhi or painted earthen pots
                (and their lids). These are examples of folk art. But there is
                another form of art which is called modern art, which owes its
                origin to the industrial revolution in Western Europe in the
                middle of-19th century and the changes it brought in technology.
                education, manufacturing and communication. Modern art rejected
                traditional art forms and began to create new types of artistic
                expression using styles, techniques, colours and materials that
                could adequately reflect the spirit of the time and the profound
                changes in human thought. (Unit-2: Lesson-3(B)) <br />

                She could tell him about the dress she was wearing that day.
                Mother made most of her dresses, but this one came from a shop.
                Her clothes were always torn when she came home in the late
                afternoon. Some of the rips were quite bad. Mother never knew
                how they got that way. Even her white cotton panties were
                sometimes in shreds. She explained to the headmaster that they
                got torn when she crossed other people's gardens by crawling
                under their fences, and when she burrowed under the barbed wire
                around vacant lots. So this morning, she said, when she was
                getting dressed to come here, all the nice dresses Mother had
                made were torn so she had to wear one Mother had bought. It had
                small dark red and gray checks and was made of jersey, and it
                wasn't bad, but Mother thought the red flowers embroidered on
                the collar were in bad taste. <br />
                <br />
                "Mother doesn't like the collar," said Totto-chan, holding it up
                for the headmaster to see. After that, she could think of
                nothing more to say no matter how hard she tried. It made her
                rather sad. But just then the headmaster got up, placed his
                large, warm hand on her head, and said, "Well, now you're a
                pupil of this school." <br />

                1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                Sheikh Mohammed Sultan, widely known as SM Sultan, was a
                distinguished Bangladeshi painter renowned for his distinctive
                personal and artistic style. Born on August 10, 1923, in
                Jessore, Bangladesh. Sultan is often remembered as a bohemian
                artist who traveled extensively. Despite his unique vision, he
                only achieved widespread recognition later in life. His work was
                first showcased in Dhaka in 1976, and a significant
                retrospective organized by the Goethe Institute, Dhaka in 1987
                solidified his status as a major artist. Despite coming from an
                underprivileged background, SM Sultan made his mark in the art
                world through sheer passion and his ability to build enduring
                connections. Although his family could not afford his education
                at the Calcutta School of Arts, he received a special
                recommendation that allowed him to study there for three years.{" "}
                <br />
                His very simple but highly philosophic art, which affected
                nature and the people of Bangladesh, has become the prime source
                of inspiration for the new generation of painters. Sultan's
                characters were farmers, rural women, children, animals, and
                even pets. The main feature of his paintings is the muscular
                farmers. with extensive muscles and godly physical stature which
                make his farmers larger than life. Sultan took little care of
                his finished works, and many are lost. He was unconcerned about
                using materials that would preserve. Sultan's song was never
                about a legacy of artwork but of ideas. <br />
                Apart from being awarded prestigious awards, accolades, and
                being featured in top art institutions. Sultan received wide
                press coverage and laudatory critical reviews in renowned
                newspapers like the New York Times, Washington Post, The
                Telegraph. The Times. The Guardian, Le Monde, and many more. He
                became internationally acclaimed as a great painter of classic
                dimensions. Sultan received the Ekushey Padak, Swadhinata Padak,
                Bangladesh Charu Shilpi Sangsad Padak, and other prestigious
                awards! <br />

                Jerry began to chop. The blows were rhythmic and steady, and
                shortly I had forgotten him, the sound no more of an
                interruption than a consistent rain. I suppose an hour and a
                half passed and I heard the boy's steps on the cabin stoop....
                The boy said, "I have to go to supper now," he said. "I can come
                again tomorrow." <br />
                I said, "I'll pay you now for what you've done," thinking I
                should probably have to insist on an older boy.... <br />
                We went together back to the cabin. An astonishing amount of
                solid wood had been cut.... "But you've done as much as a man,"
                I said. "This is a splendid pile." <br />
                I looked at him, actually, for the first time. His hair was the
                color of the com shocks and his eyes, very direct, were like the
                mountain sky when rain is pending - gray, with a shadowing of
                that miraculous blue.... I gave him a quarter. <br />
                "You may come tomorrow afternoon," I said, "and thank you very
                much." <br />

                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  Novera Ahmed was the pioneer of modern sculpting in
                  Bangladesh. She is also one of the most under-and
                  misrepresented artists in the country. When describing the
                  works of the first modern Bangladeshi sculptor Novera Alımed,
                  Shilpacharja Zainul Abedin proclaimed "What Novera is doing
                  now will take us a long time to understand -she is that kind
                  of artist. This aptly describes her progressive thoughts in{" "}
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  the field of sculpture. Novera Ahmed was born in a culturally
                  inclined family in Chittagong, where she was inspired by her
                  mother's skills in making dolls' houses out of clay and became
                  fascinated with working with three-dimensional forms. As Ahmed
                  was educated in London and Florence, her sculptural vocabulary
                  was based on a combination of western ideas and folk
                  traditions. Many of her artefacts were based on village lives
                  and folk motifs, of which she was a keen observer. She also
                  incorporated Buddhist themes in her works, and developed an
                  individual style that depicted the experiences of women.{" "}
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In August 1960, Novera Ahmed had her first solo exhibition
                  organised on the ground floor of Central Public Library (now
                  Dhaka University Library). It was the first-ever solo
                  sculpture exhibition by any sculptor of Bangladesh (East
                  Pakistan back then). It was inaugurated by General Azam Khan
                  of the Pakistan Army, who was so impressed with her work that
                  he gave her a grant of $10,000 to promote sculpture as an art
                  form. She used cement, wood, plaster and stone for the
                  material for her sculptures. In the early 1960s, upon the
                  Pakistan Art Council's invitation, she moved to West Pakistan

                  Also, relationships are of different kinds. Some are familial
                  and intimate, formed by blood and by marriage: some are social
                  like the ones we have with friends and some are made in
                  schools where we form close bonds with classmates and
                  teachers. Relationships can also be fostered in workplace,
                  which may quickly change from professional to social. There
                  are relationships between human beings and animals, between
                  children and their toys that they cannot part with. All these
                  relationships keep us close to each other and provide us all
                  kinds of support, love and affection. A person who has no
                  family feels the pain of loneliness and isolation. There is no
                  one to laugh or cry with him/her. When we share our joy with
                  someone, it simply redoubles, and when we suffer a loss and
                  someone shares our sorrow, it lessens. Relationships are thus
                  needed for our emotional health. <br />

                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  On the Island of Crete, the fearsome Minotaur, a creature that
                  was half-man and half-bull, terrorized the inhabitants. To
                  contain the beast, King Minos enlisted the help of Daedalus, a
                  masterful architect and inventor. Daedalus constructed an
                  intricate labyrinth so complex that escape was nearly
                  Impossible. Once the Minotaur was imprisoned within the maze,
                  King Minos believed he had the perfect trap for his enemies,
                  who would be sent into the labyrinth to meet a gruesome end.{" "}
                  <br />
                  However, King Minos, no longer needing Daedalus, cruelly
                  imprisoned the inventor and his son, Icarus. within the same
                  labyrinth. Yet, Daedalus, familiar with the labyrinth's
                  design, managed to escape with Icarus. After fleeing, they
                  found themselves stranded on the island with no means of
                  escape by sea. Observing the birds flying above, Daedalus was
                  inspired to craft wings from feathers and wax for himself and
                  his son. He warned Icarus to fly at a moderate height-too
                  close to the sea, and the wings would become heavy with
                  moisture ; too close to the sun, and the wax would melt.{" "}
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Initially. Icarus heeded his father's advice, but soon,
                  overwhelmed by the excitement of the flight, he soared higher
                  and higher, forgetting the warning. As he ascended, the sun's
                  heat melted the wax binding his wings. Helplessly, Icarus
                  plummeted into the sea and drowned, leaving Daedalus to fly on
                  alone, devastated by his son's tragic fate. He eventually
                  reached Sicily, where he mourned Icarus and named the sea
                  where his son fell the Icarian Sea in his memory. [Unit-3;

                  One of the main advantages I see of Al in the classroom is
                  personalised learning. Al-powered educational tools can
                  analyse data on student performance and provide tailored
                  support to improve their grades. <br />
                  Al can also provide instant feedback. For example, Al-powered
                  educational tools can provide students with immediate feedback
                  on their work, allowing them to identify and correct mistakes
                  quickly. <br /> [Unit-1:Lesson-2(B)) <br />

                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  According to some myths and legends, Gazi Pir was a Muslim
                  saint who is said to have spread Islam in the parts of Bengal
                  close to the Sundarbans. He was credited with many miracles.
                  For example, he could supposedly calm dangerous animals and
                  make them docile. He is usually depicted in paats or scroll
                  paintings riding a fierce looking Bengal tiger, a snake in his
                  hand, but in no apparent danger. According to some stories, he
                  also fought crocodiles who threatened the people of the region
                  full of canals and creeks, indeed, a kind of watery jungle
                  bordering the Bay of Bengal. Because of his alert and vigilant
                  presence, all predatory animals were said to have been kept
                  within bounds. It was also believed that he enabled villagers
                  to live close to forests and jungles and cultivate their
                  lands. Consequently, people of these regions would pray to him
                  for protection. The story of Gazi Pir has been preserved in
                  folk literature as well as art and has been performed in
                  indigenous theatre. Some Gazir paat scrolls are part of the
                  collection of the British Museum. (Unit-3; Lesson-3(B))

                  2. Read the following text and make a flow chart showing the
                  multifarious features of Bangladeshi music. (No. 1 has been
                  done for you) 2 x 5 = 10 <br />
                  In Bangladesh folk music has great variety. with songs being
                  composed on the culture, festivals, views of life, natural
                  beauty, rivers and rural and riverine life. These songs are
                  also about social Inequality and poverty, about the material
                  world and the supernatural. Mystical songs have been composed
                  using the metaphors of rivers and boats. Since the country is
                  basically riverine, the Bhatiyall forms an important genre of
                  folk music. Folk music is formed and develops according to the
                  environment. Differences in the natural environment are
                  reflected in the people of the different regions. The dialects
                  too vary across the different regions. Bangladeshi folk music
                  therefore varies from region to region. Thus there are the
                  northern Bhawaiya, the eastern Bhatiyali and the southwestern
                  Baul songs. <br />
                  The culture and the lifestyle of the different tribes have
                  also influenced folk music. Tribes like the Santal, Garo,

                  Jodi borshe magher shesh, dhonyi rajar punyi desh. <br />
                  If it rains at the end of Magh (last month of Winter), the
                  kingdom will prosper. The mystery that connects seasons with
                  soil and crops with rain was no secret to her. She realized
                  the interdependence that links people and climate in myriad
                  ways. She was Khona. The mythical story of Khona is deeply
                  rooted in Bangla folklore. Khona, originally named Lila, was
                  an incredible woman with a gift for predicting weather and
                  understanding the ways of farming. Her wisdom was shared
                  through memorable, rhyming verses known as "Khona's Words" or
                  "Khonar Bochon." These sayings, though simple and easy to
                  remember, were filled with deep knowledge and practical advice
                  for farmers. <br />
                  Khona used her knowledge to help the peasants, but her actions
                  often challenged the ruling class. The rulers, not pleased
                  with her defiance, punished her cruelly by cutting out her
                  tongue. Thus, she became known as Khona, which means "someone
                  who cannot speak." Despite this harsh punishment, her wisdom
                  lived on through her sayings, which have been passed down for
                  over 1500 years. <br />
                  There are many versions of Khona's story. One retelling goes
                  like this: in the kingdom of Deyulnagar. there was a royal
                  astrologer named Varaha who served King Dharmaketu. Sadly,
                  Varaha's wife died while giving birth to their son. Mihir.{" "}
                  <br />
                  Worried about his son's future, Varaha saw in the stars that
                  Mihir was defined for a life of trouble and death.
                  Heartbroken, Varaha decided to save Mihir by placing him in a
                  copper pot and setting the pot afloat on the river
                  Viddyadhory. The baby was found and rescued in Sri Lanka,
                  where he was raised by the king. As he grew up in the royal
                  court, he married the king's daughter, an astrologer herself.
                  named Lila. <br />
                  Lila and Mihir managed to find Varaha and prove that his
                  predictions about Mihir's future had been wrong. Varaha,
                  though surprised by his mistake, was thrilled to see his son
                  again and welcomed both Mihir and Lila warmly. They were soon
                  introduced to the royal court and became royal astrologers
                  themselves. <br />
                  Even though Lila was now a royal astrologer, she kept in touch
                  with the local farmers. She learned a lot from them and found
                  that they shared valuable knowledge through short,
                  easy-to-remember verses. <br />
                  Lila began to use these simple verses to explain her own
                  complex astrological knowledge. Varaha, feeling jealous and
                  angry, ordered his son to punish Lila by cutting out her
                  tongue, hoping to silence her. However, Khona's story and her
                  knowledge remained alive. Her wisdom about nature-oriented
                  farming continued to benefit the people of the land. <br />{" "}
