                1 Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                Once upon a time there lived a bird. It was unlettered. It sang
                but couldn't recite a word of scripture. hopped and it flew but
                lacked all sense of manners. <br />
                The King said, "Such a bird is of no use. Yet it devours fruit
                from the forest, bringing down the profits of fruiterers in the
                royal market." <br />
                He summoned the Minister and commanded, "Educate the bird!"{" "}
                <br />
                The task of educating the bird fell on the King's nephews, his
                sisters' sons. The learned men of the court deliberated long.
                They pondered the reasons behind the ignorance of the creature
                in question. The conclusion: the bird's nest made of straw and
                twigs could not hold much knowledge. Therefore, the first thing
                needed was a proper cage. <br />
                The royal scholars received handsome fees and happily went home.
                A goldsmith set to work on a gilded cage. It turned out to be of
                such exquisite workmanship that people from far and near crowded
                round for a look. Some said, "This is education par excellence."
                Others said, "Even if it learns nothing, it has got the cage.
                What a lucky bird." The goldsmith was delighted to get a bagful
                of money as reward and went home at once. <br />
                A teacher came to give lessons to the bird. He took a pinch of
                snuff and declared, "This isn't a matter of just a few texts."
                One of the royal nephews sent for scribes. They made multiple
                copies of various texts until there was a veritable mountain.
                "Bravol" exclaimed those who saw it, "There is no room for any
                more knowledge." The scribes loaded their wages onto bullocks
                and merrily headed home. They would never again want for
                anything. <br />
                The nephews were constantly busy looking after the expensive
                cage. Repairs were always under way. Anyone who saw the endless
                dusting, wiping and polishing had to agree that there was
                "marked Improvement". <br />
                A large maintenance crew was needed, and more personnel to
                supervise them. They all got handsome monthly salaries, which
                they saved in their wooden chests. Even their cousins came to
                live with them in cushioned comfort. <br />

                authoress was in the Carolina mountains and what she was
                homesick for. (No. 1 has been done for you) <br />
                The orphanage is high in the Carolina mountains. I was there in
                the autumn. I wanted quiet, isolation, to do some troublesome
                writing. I wanted mountain air to blow out the malaria from too
                long a time in the subtropics. I was homesick too, for the
                flaming of maples in October, and for corn shocks and pumpkins
                and black-walnut trees.... I found them all living in a cabin
                that belonged to the orphanage, half a mile beyond the orphanage
                farm. When I took the cabin, I asked a boy or man to come and
                chop wood for the fireplace.... <br />
                door and I looked up from my typewriter one late afternoon, a
                little startled. A boy stood at the pointer dog, my companion,
                was at his side and had not barked to warn me. The boy was
                probably twelve years old, but undersized. He wore overalls and
                a torn shirt, and was barefooted. <br />
                <br />

              Model Question - 02 English (Compulsory)- First Paper Full marks:
              100 Time: 3 hours [Answer all the questions. Figures in the margin
              indicate full marks. PART-A: READING TEST [60 Marks] 1. Read the
              passage and answer the questions A and B. Artificial intelligence
              has the potential to revolutionise the way we learn and teach. As
              a tool in the classroom, Al can provide students with personalised
              learning experiences, automate repetitive tasks and provide
              instant feedback. However, it also has its limitations. Let us
              explore the pros and cons of Al as a tool in the classroom,
              address the concern that Al could be a threat to teachers' and
              Instructors' Jobs and discuss the role of edtech companies in
              advancing this Al use case. Advantages of Al in the Classroom One
              of the main advantages I see of Al in the classroom is
              personalised learning. Al-powered educational tools can analyse
              data on student performance and provide tailored support to
              improve their grades. Al can also provide Instant feedback. For
              example, Al-powered educational tools can provide students with
              immediate feedback on their work, allowing them to identify and
              correct mistakes quickly. Another advantage of Al is its ability
              to automate repetitive tasks. It can grade assignments and
              quizzes, which can free up teachers' time for other tasks, such as
              lesson planning and providing more one-on-one attention to
              students. There are already a few Al tools that support learning
              in classroom or workplace contexts. For example, Ahura is an
              Al-powered learning assistant that tracks learning habits by
              observing attention and engagement. Knewton offers an adaptive
              learning platform that provides personalized learning experiences
              for students. Querium is an Al-powered tutor that provides
              students with step-by-step tutoring on math problems and builds
              personalized lesson plans. ALEKS is an Al-powered learning
              platform that provides individualized learning paths based on
              students' strengths and weaknesses. Carnegie Learning offers an
              Al-powered tutor that helps students improve their math skills by
              providing personalised learning based on their performance.
              There's also Smart Sparrow, which allows users to provide
              constructive feedback that is unique to each Student. Finally,
              Gradescope is an Al-powered grading tool that automates the
              grading process, which can free up teachers' time and allow them
              to provide more individualised attention to students. These are
              just a few examples of Al tools with applications in the
              classroom. It is important to note that these tools should not
              replace teachers but rather assist them in their work. [Unit-1;
              Lesson-2(B)) A. Choose the correct answer from the alternatives:

              showing Varaha's activity. (one is done for you) 2x 5= 10 There
              are many versions of Khona's story. One retelling goes like this:
              in the kingdom of Deyulnagar, there was a royal astrologer named
              Varaha who served King Dharmaketu. Sadly, Varaha's wife died while
              giving birth to their son, Mihir. Worried about his son's future,
              Varaha saw in the stars that Mihir was defined for a life of
              trouble and death. Heartbroken, Varaha decided to save Mihir by
              placing him in a copper pot and setting the pot afloat on the
              river Viddyadhory. The baby was found and rescued in Sri Lanka,
              where he was raised by the king. As he grew up in the royal court,
              he married the king's daughter, an astrologer herself, named Lila.
              Lila and Mihir managed to find Varaha and prove that his
              predictions about Mihir's future had been wrong. Varaha, though
              surprised by his mistake, was thrilled to see his son again and
              welcomed both Mihir and Lila warmly. They were soon introduced to
              the royal court and became royal astrologers themselves. vinu
              divor Even though Lila was now a royal astrologer, she kept in
              touch with the local farmers. She learned a lot from them and
              found that they shared valuable knowledge through short,
              easy-to-remember verses. Lila began to use these simple verses to
              explain her own complex astrological knowledge. Varaha, feeling
              jealous and angry, ordered his son to punish Lila by cutting out
              her tongue, hoping to silence her. However, Khona's story and her
              knowledge remained alive. Her wisdom about nature-oriented farming
              continued to benefit the people of the land.[Unit-3; Lesson-4(B))
              1. Being a royal astrologer → 2. → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6.
