                  </p>
                  Once upon a time there lived a bird. It was unlettered. It
                  sang but couldn't recite a word of scripture. hopped and it
                  flew but lacked all sense of manners. <br />
                  The King said, "Such a bird is of no use. Yet it devours fruit
                  from the forest, bringing down the profits of fruiterers in
                  the royal market." <br />
                  He summoned the Minister and commanded, "Educate the bird!"{" "}
                  <br />
                  The task of educating the bird fell on the King's nephews, his
                  sisters' sons. <br />
                  The learned men of the court deliberated long. They pondered
                  the reasons behind the ignorance of the creature in question.
                  The conclusion: the bird's nest made of straw and twigs could
                  not hold much knowledge. Therefore, the first thing needed was
                  a proper cage. <br />
                  The royal scholars received handsome fees and happily went
                  home. <br />
                  A goldsmith set to work on a gilded cage. It turned out to be
                  of such exquisite workmanship that people from far and near
                  crowded round for a look. Some said, "This is education par
                  excellence." Others said, "Even if it learns nothing, it has
                  got the cage. What a lucky bird." <br />
                  The goldsmith was delighted to get a bagful of money as reward
                  and went home at once.
                  <br />
                  A teacher came to give lessons to the bird. He took a pinch of
                  snuff and declared, "This isn't a matter of just a few texts."
                  <br />
                  One of the royal nephews sent for scribes. They made multiple
                  copies of various texts until there was a veritable mountain.
                  "Bravo !" exclaimed those who saw it, "There is no room for
                  any more knowledge." <br />
                  The scribes loaded their wages onto bullocks and merrily
                  headed home. They would never again want for anything. <br />
                  The nephews were constantly busy looking after the expensive
                  cage. Repairs were always under way. Anyone who saw the
                  endless dusting, wiping and polishing had to agree that there
                  was "marked Improvement". <br />
                  A large maintenance crew was needed, and more personnel to
                  supervise them. They all got handsome monthly salaries, which
                  they saved in their wooden chests. Even their cousins came to
                  live with them in cushioned comfort. <br />

                  </p>
                  The orphanage is high in the Carolina mountains. I was there
                  in the autumn. I wanted quiet, isolation, to do some
                  troublesome writing. I wanted mountain air to blow out the
                  malaria from too long a time in the subtropics. I was homesick
                  too, for the flaming of maples in October, and for corn shocks
                  and pumpkins and black-walnut trees.... I found them all
                  living in a cabin that belonged to the orphanage, half a mile
                  beyond the orphanage farm. When I took the cabin, I asked a
                  boy or man to come and chop wood for the fireplace.... <br />
                  door and I looked up from my typewriter one late afternoon, a
                  little startled. A boy stood at the pointer dog, my companion,
                  was at his side and had not barked to warn me. The boy was
                  probably twelve years old, but undersized. He wore overalls
                  and a torn shirt, and was barefooted. <br />

                    A. Multiple choice: <br />
                    (a) ii. civility (b) iii. fortunate (c) 1. useless (d) iv.
                    fond of flattery (e) ii. the bad effects of unnecessary

                    <br />
                    B. Open-ended question <br />
                    (a) The actual beneficiaries were those who were engaged in
                    training the bird. They were, namely-royal scholars,
                    goldsmiths, a teacher, the scribes and the king's nephews.{" "}
                    <br />
                    (b) The story reflects the real picture of our society in
                    respect of imparting education. It shows that everything is
                    done here inappropriately. <br />
                    (c) No, not at all. The arrangements were taken but they
                    were all wrong. And the people who were selected for the
                    purpose were impudent or shameless. <br />
                    (d) The message of the story is that we should avoid absurd
                    and useless attempts for silly or unnecessary matters.
                    Because that is nothing but a mere wastage of money, time
                    and energy. <br />
                    (e) Yes, I think the story is a satire. The author satirizes
                    the absurd ways of imparting education that ultimately
                    becomes a failure and wastage of public money.

                Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionise the
                way we learn and teach. As a tool in the classroom, Al can
                provide students with personalised learning experiences,
                automate repetitive tasks and provide instant feedback. However,
                it also has its limitations. Let us explore the pros and cons of
                Al as a tool in the classroom, address the concern that Al could
                be a threat to teachers' and Instructors' Jobs and discuss the
                role of edtech companies in advancing this Al use case. <br />
                Advantages of Al in the Classroom <br />
                One of the main advantages I see of Al in the classroom is
                personalised learning. Al-powered educational tools can analyse
                data on student performance and provide tailored support to
                improve their grades. <br />
                Al can also provide Instant feedback. For example, Al-powered
                educational tools can provide students with immediate feedback
                on their work, allowing them to identify and correct mistakes
                quickly. <br />
                Another advantage of Al is its ability to automate repetitive
                tasks. It can grade assignments and quizzes, which can free up
                teachers' time for other tasks, such as lesson planning and
                providing more one-on-one attention to students. <br />
                There are already a few Al tools that support learning in
                classroom or workplace contexts. For example, Ahura is an
                Al-powered learning assistant that tracks learning habits by
                observing attention and engagement. Knewton offers an adaptive
                learning platform that provides personalized learning
                experiences for students. Querium is an Al-powered tutor that
                provides students with step-by-step tutoring on math problems
                and builds personalized lesson plans. ALEKS is an Al-powered
                learning platform that provides individualized learning paths
                based on students' strengths and weaknesses. Carnegie Learning
                offers an Al-powered tutor that helps students improve their
                math skills by providing personalised learning based on their
                performance. There's also Smart Sparrow, which allows users to
                provide constructive feedback that is unique to each Student.
                <br />
                Finally, Gradescope is an Al-powered grading tool that automates
                the grading process, which can free up teachers' time and allow
                them to provide more individualised attention to students. These
                are just a few examples of Al tools with applications in the
                classroom. It is important to note that these tools should not
                replace teachers but rather assist them in their work. <br />

                Varaha's activity. (one is done for you) 2x 5= 10 <br />
                There are many versions of Khona's story. One retelling goes
                like this: in the kingdom of Deyulnagar, there was a royal
                astrologer named Varaha who served King Dharmaketu. Sadly,
                Varaha's wife died while giving birth to their son, Mihir.
                <br />
                Worried about his son's future, Varaha saw in the stars that
                Mihir was defined for a life of trouble and death. Heartbroken,
                Varaha decided to save Mihir by placing him in a copper pot and
                setting the pot afloat on the river Viddyadhory. The baby was
                found and rescued in Sri Lanka, where he was raised by the king.
                As he grew up in the royal court, he married the king's
                daughter, an astrologer herself, named Lila. <br />
                Lila and Mihir managed to find Varaha and prove that his
                predictions about Mihir's future had been wrong. Varaha, though
                surprised by his mistake, was thrilled to see his son again and
                welcomed both Mihir and Lila warmly. They were soon introduced
                to the royal court and became royal astrologers themselves. vinu
                divor <br />
                <br />
                Even though Lila was now a royal astrologer, she kept in touch
                with the local farmers. She learned a lot from them and found
                that they shared valuable knowledge through short,
                easy-to-remember verses. Lila began to use these simple verses
                to explain her own complex astrological knowledge. Varaha,
                feeling jealous and angry, ordered his son to punish Lila by
                cutting out her tongue, hoping to silence her. However, Khona's
                story and her knowledge remained alive. Her wisdom about
                nature-oriented farming continued to benefit the people of the
                land.[Unit-3; Lesson-4(B)] <br />

                1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                Education aims to bring about positive changes in our behavior.
                It helps us try to change our lives as well as the society we
                live in. Education that does not illuminate our minds or does
                not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all.
                Education is not all about getting grades or receiving
                certificates we use education to make life better. We are
                expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn
                in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies
                outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a
                look at how education works. <br />
                Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the
                world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in
                the civic life (the public life of the citizens as contrasted
                with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge,
                skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the
                quality of life in a community by contributing to the
                improvement of health and wellbeing of the people. Civically
                engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger
                social community and are concerned about civic issues. They
                consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or
                raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other
                forms of social ills. <br />
                In civic engagement, Issues of public concern are crucial. Civic
                engagement includes individual or group activities to protect
                public interests and change the way the community values itself.
                For example, if you are protesting against any unjust decision
                of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that
                might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged
                and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest
                can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies.
                collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions,
                etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school,
                help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park
                or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly
                people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you
                do directly affects the community. <br />
                When civic engagement is a part of an academic programme, and
                the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it
                is called service learning. It involves the application of
                knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a
                complete plan of action i.e. preparing a budget, starting the
                process of implementation, involving people and activating
                operational strategies. When civic engagement is spontaneous but
                irregular and not a part of any academic programme, it is
                considered volunteerism. <br /> [Unit-1: Lesson-4(C)] <br />

                to Sheikh Hasina fleeing the country. (No. 1 has been done for
                you.) 2x5=10 <br />
                The July Uprising was a mass movement in Bangladesh that led to
                the overthrow of Sheikh Hasina's regime in July-August 2024.
                Also referred to as the 'Monsoon Revolution' or 'July
                Revolution, the movement began with a student-led protest at
                Dhaka University demanding quota reform in public service. The
                government's brutal repression and the tragic loss of life
                transformed the initially apolitical protest into a widespread
                uprising that united various political, cultural, social, and
                religious groups. This collective mobilization ultimately led to
                Sheikh Hasina fleeing the country. The uprising was not a sudden
                event, rather it was the culmination of 16 years of public
                frustration stemming from tyranny, human rights abuses, and the
                systematic dismantling of state institutions. [Unit-4;

                1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                In Bangladesh folk music has great variety, with songs being
                composed on the culture, festivals, views cial inequality of
                life, natural beauty, rivers and rural and riverine life. These
                songs are also about social and poverty, about the material
                world and the supernatural. Mystical songs have been composed
                using the metaphors of rivers and boats. Since the country is
                basically riverine, the Bhatiyali forms an important genre of
                folk music. Nature plays a role in providing the content and
                rhythm of folk music. <br />
                The folk music of Bangladesh varies from region to region
                reflecting changes in the natural environment and the dialects
                people use. Thus there are the northern Bhawalya, the eastern
                Bhatiyall and the southwestern Baul songs. The culture and the
                lifestyle of the different ethnic minorities, such as the
                Chakmas, manipuris, Santals or Tripuris, have also influenced
                fold music. Their interaction with Bengali culture and lifestyle
                over the years has been clearly reflected in the richness of our
                folk music. <br />
                Folk songs may be sung individually or in chorus. Folk songs
                sung individually include Baul. Bhatiyali. Murshidi and Marfati,
                while songs sung in chorus include Kabigan, Leto, Alkap and
                Gambhira. Some songs are regional in character, but others are
                common to both Bangladesh and West Bengal. Similarly, some songs
                belong distinctively to one religious community, the Hindus or
                the Muslims, other cross religious boundaries. Some songs belong
                exclusively to men, others to women, while some are sung by both
                men and women. <br />
                Thus only women compose and sing Bratagan and Meyeli Git, but
                both men and women participate in the old practice of
                'roof-beating songs that are sung while beating down and firming
                rooftops. <br /> [Unir-2: Lesson-2(B)] <br />

                borshe magher shesh, dhonyi rajar punyi desh. <br />
                If it rains at the end of Magh (last month of Winter), the
                kingdom will prosper. <br />
                The mystery that connects seasons with soil and crops with rain
                was no secret to her. She realized the interdependence that
                links people and climate in myriad ways. She was Khona. <br />
                The mythical story of Khona is deeply rooted in Bangla folklore.
                Khona, originally named Lila, was an incredible woman with a
                gift for predicting weather and understanding the ways of
                farming. Her wisdom was shared through memorable, rhyming verses
                known as "Khona's Words" or "Khonar Bochon." These sayings,
                though simple and easy to remember, were filled with deep
                knowledge and practical advice for farmers. <br />
                Khona used her knowledge to help the peasants, but her actions
                often challenged the ruling class. The rulers, not pleased with
                her defiance, punished her cruelly by cutting out her tongue.
                Thus, she became known as Khona, which means "someone who cannot
                speak." Despite this harsh punishment, her wisdom lived on
                through her sayings, which have been passed down for over 1500
                years.[Unit-3: Lesson-4(B)] <br />

                1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                Lalon Shah (1774-1890) is best known as an icon of the Baul
                tradition in Bengal, although he was also a philosopher, thinker
                and social reformer. He preached religious tolerance and
                rejected social differences based on class, caste and creed. He
                also believed that a search for truth should begin with the
                body, which reflects the mystery of creation. <br />
                <br />
                Although Lalon's songs are admired for the profound
                philosophical and mystical insights they offer, he did not
                receive any formal education. Not much is known about his early
                life. A popular story about him- which many believe to be true-
                is that while on a pilgrimage to a holy place, Lalon, who was
                born a Hindu, contracted smallpox and was abandoned by his
                companions. A Muslim fakir, Siraj Sain. picked him up and took
                him to his own house where he nursed him back to health. When
                Lalon returned home, his family refused to take him in as he had
                lived in a Muslim household. So Lalon returned to Siraj Sain and
                took up a life of devotion and asceticism under his guidance.
                After the death of Sainji, Lalon set up an akhrah or monastery
                in Chheuriya near Kushtia. It soon attracted admirers and
                mystics in search of salvation who became initiated into Baul
                asceticism and became his disciples. As Lalon began writing and
                composing songs, which his disciples sang with the accompaniment
                of ektara or dotara, his fame spread to faraway places.
                Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam were among those who
                admired him and were influenced by his shahajiya philosophy (the
                attainment of the self through the simple truths that reside in
                one's own body and soul-not outside - which can be reached
                through sadhana or meditation). Many of his disciples also
                became famous for their songs. They included Kangal Harinath
                Majumder, Pagla Kanal and Dudu Shah.[Unit-2; Lesson-2(F)] <br />

                2. Read the following text and make a flow chart showing the
                king's attitude and activities related to the bird's education.
                (No. 1 has been done for you) 2 x 5 = 10 <br />
                Once upon a time there lived a bird. It was unlettered. It sang
                but couldn't recite a word of scripture. It hopped and it flew
                but lacked all sense of manners. <br />
                The King said, "Such a bird is of no use. Yet it devours fruit
                from the forest, bringing down the profits of fruiterers in the
                royal market." <br />
                He summoned the Minister and commanded, "Educate the bird!"
                <br />
                The task of educating the bird fell on the King's nephews, his
                sisters' sons. <br />
                The learned men of the court deliberated long. They pondered the
                reasons behind the ignorance of the creature in question. The
                conclusion: the bird's nest made of straw and twigs could not
                hold much knowledge. Therefore, the first thing needed was a
                proper cage. <br />
                The royal scholars received handsome fees and happily went home.

                1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                Art is generally understood as an expression of human
                Imagination and creative skills in a range of activities
                including painting, drawing, sculpture and architecture. The aim
                of art is to evoke feelings and emotions that are considered
                aesthetic- that is, concerned with beauty- but art also can be a
                form of social commentary. A painting of sunset over the sea
                glorifies nature, but one that shows a war ravaged town can
                convey a sense of anguish. Throughout the world people
                appreciate art for its power to affect them in creative ways. As
                the famous painter Pablo Picasso said, "the purpose of art is
                washing the dust of daily life off our souls." <br />
                Art in our country has a long history. It has been practiced in
                households in the form of pottery. nakshikantha or embroidered
                quilt, alpana or intricate, mostly floral designs in rice paste
                done on clay yards and shokher harhi or painted earthen pots
                (and their lids). These are examples of folk art. But there is
                another form of art which is called modern art, which owes its
                origin to the industrial revolution in Western Europe in the
                middle of-19th century and the changes it brought in technology.
                education, manufacturing and communication. Modern art rejected
                traditional art forms and began to create new types of artistic
                expression using styles, techniques, colours and materials that
                could adequately reflect the spirit of the time and the profound
                changes in human thought. (Unit-2: Lesson-3(B)) <br />

                She could tell him about the dress she was wearing that day.
                Mother made most of her dresses, but this one came from a shop.
                Her clothes were always torn when she came home in the late
                afternoon. Some of the rips were quite bad. Mother never knew
                how they got that way. Even her white cotton panties were
                sometimes in shreds. She explained to the headmaster that they
                got torn when she crossed other people's gardens by crawling
                under their fences, and when she burrowed under the barbed wire
                around vacant lots. So this morning, she said, when she was
                getting dressed to come here, all the nice dresses Mother had
                made were torn so she had to wear one Mother had bought. It had

                wasn't bad, but Mother thought the red flowers embroidered on
                the collar were in bad taste. <br />
                <br />
                "Mother doesn't like the collar," said Totto-chan, holding it up
                for the headmaster to see. After that, she could think of
                nothing more to say no matter how hard she tried. It made her
                rather sad. But just then the headmaster got up, placed his
                large, warm hand on her head, and said, "Well, now you're a
                pupil of this school." <br />

                1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                Sheikh Mohammed Sultan, widely known as SM Sultan, was a
                distinguished Bangladeshi painter renowned for his distinctive
                personal and artistic style. Born on August 10, 1923, in
                Jessore, Bangladesh. Sultan is often remembered as a bohemian
                artist who traveled extensively. Despite his unique vision, he
                only achieved widespread recognition later in life. His work was
                first showcased in Dhaka in 1976, and a significant
                retrospective organized by the Goethe Institute, Dhaka in 1987
                solidified his status as a major artist. Despite coming from an
                underprivileged background, SM Sultan made his mark in the art
                world through sheer passion and his ability to build enduring
                connections. Although his family could not afford his education
                at the Calcutta School of Arts, he received a special
                recommendation that allowed him to study there for three years.
                <br />
                His very simple but highly philosophic art, which affected
                nature and the people of Bangladesh, has become the prime source
                of inspiration for the new generation of painters. Sultan's
                characters were farmers, rural women, children, animals, and
                even pets. The main feature of his paintings is the muscular
                farmers. with extensive muscles and godly physical stature which
                make his farmers larger than life. Sultan took little care of
                his finished works, and many are lost. He was unconcerned about
                using materials that would preserve. Sultan's song was never
                about a legacy of artwork but of ideas. <br />
                Apart from being awarded prestigious awards, accolades, and
                being featured in top art institutions. Sultan received wide
                press coverage and laudatory critical reviews in renowned
                newspapers like the New York Times, Washington Post, The
                Telegraph. The Times. The Guardian, Le Monde, and many more. He
                became internationally acclaimed as a great painter of classic
                dimensions. Sultan received the Ekushey Padak, Swadhinata Padak,
                Bangladesh Charu Shilpi Sangsad Padak, and other prestigious
                awards! <br />

                2. Read the following text and make a flow chart showing Jerry's
                activities of chopping woods as a labourer. (No. 1 has been done
                for you)2 × 5 = 10 <br />
                Jerry began to chop. The blows were rhythmic and steady, and
                shortly I had forgotten him, the sound no more of an
                interruption than a consistent rain. I suppose an hour and a
                half passed and I heard the boy's steps on the cabin stoop....
                The boy said, "I have to go to supper now," he said. "I can come
                again tomorrow." <br />
                I said, "I'll pay you now for what you've done," thinking I
                should probably have to insist on an older boy.... <br />
                We went together back to the cabin. An astonishing amount of
                solid wood had been cut.... "But you've done as much as a man,"
                I said. "This is a splendid pile." <br />
                I looked at him, actually, for the first time. His hair was the
                color of the com shocks and his eyes, very direct, were like the
                mountain sky when rain is pending - gray, with a shadowing of
                that miraculous blue.... I gave him a quarter. <br />
                "You may come tomorrow afternoon," I said, "and thank you very
                much." <br />

                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  Novera Ahmed was the pioneer of modern sculpting in
                  Bangladesh. She is also one of the most under-and
                  misrepresented artists in the country. When describing the
                  works of the first modern Bangladeshi sculptor Novera Alımed,
                  Shilpacharja Zainul Abedin proclaimed "What Novera is doing
                  now will take us a long time to understand -she is that kind
                  of artist. This aptly describes her progressive thoughts in
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  the field of sculpture. Novera Ahmed was born in a culturally
                  inclined family in Chittagong, where she was inspired by her
                  mother's skills in making dolls' houses out of clay and became
                  fascinated with working with three-dimensional forms. As Ahmed
                  was educated in London and Florence, her sculptural vocabulary
                  was based on a combination of western ideas and folk
                  traditions. Many of her artefacts were based on village lives
                  and folk motifs, of which she was a keen observer. She also
                  incorporated Buddhist themes in her works, and developed an
                  individual style that depicted the experiences of women.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In August 1960, Novera Ahmed had her first solo exhibition
                  organised on the ground floor of Central Public Library (now
                  Dhaka University Library). It was the first-ever solo
                  sculpture exhibition by any sculptor of Bangladesh (East
                  Pakistan back then). It was inaugurated by General Azam Khan
                  of the Pakistan Army, who was so impressed with her work that
                  he gave her a grant of $10,000 to promote sculpture as an art
                  form. She used cement, wood, plaster and stone for the
                  material for her sculptures. In the early 1960s, upon the
                  Pakistan Art Council's invitation, she moved to West Pakistan
                  and produced many works there. <br />
                  <br />
                  In 1962, she traveled to Bombay to learn Bharatanatyam, and a
                  year later moved to Paris where she remained for the rest of
                  her life. She lived in Thailand from 1968 to 1970 and had her
                  second solo exhibition in Bangkok's Alliance Francaise in
                  1970. At that time she was using remains from plane crashes of
                  American airplanes from the Vietnam War. Novera Ahmed was one
                  of the original designers of the Shaheed Minar, in which she
                  collaborated with Hamidur Rahman. She was awarded the Ekushey
                  Padak in 1997 in absentia, and an exhibition was arranged from
                  her works left behind in Dhaka in April-May, 1998. <br />

                  Also, relationships are of different kinds. Some are familial
                  and intimate, formed by blood and by marriage: some are social
                  like the ones we have with friends and some are made in
                  schools where we form close bonds with classmates and
                  teachers. Relationships can also be fostered in workplace,
                  which may quickly change from professional to social. There
                  are relationships between human beings and animals, between
                  children and their toys that they cannot part with. All these
                  relationships keep us close to each other and provide us all
                  kinds of support, love and affection. A person who has no
                  family feels the pain of loneliness and isolation. There is no
                  one to laugh or cry with him/her. When we share our joy with
                  someone, it simply redoubles, and when we suffer a loss and
                  someone shares our sorrow, it lessens. Relationships are thus
                  needed for our emotional health. <br />

                  PART-A: READING TEST [60 Marks] <br />
                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  On the Island of Crete, the fearsome Minotaur, a creature that
                  was half-man and half-bull, terrorized the inhabitants. To
                  contain the beast, King Minos enlisted the help of Daedalus, a
                  masterful architect and inventor. Daedalus constructed an
                  intricate labyrinth so complex that escape was nearly
                  Impossible. Once the Minotaur was imprisoned within the maze,
                  King Minos believed he had the perfect trap for his enemies,
                  who would be sent into the labyrinth to meet a gruesome end.
                  <br />
                  However, King Minos, no longer needing Daedalus, cruelly
                  imprisoned the inventor and his son, Icarus. within the same
                  labyrinth. Yet, Daedalus, familiar with the labyrinth's
                  design, managed to escape with Icarus. After fleeing, they
                  found themselves stranded on the island with no means of
                  escape by sea. Observing the birds flying above, Daedalus was
                  inspired to craft wings from feathers and wax for himself and
                  his son. He warned Icarus to fly at a moderate height-too
                  close to the sea, and the wings would become heavy with
                  moisture ; too close to the sun, and the wax would melt.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Initially. Icarus heeded his father's advice, but soon,
                  overwhelmed by the excitement of the flight, he soared higher
                  and higher, forgetting the warning. As he ascended, the sun's
                  heat melted the wax binding his wings. Helplessly, Icarus
                  plummeted into the sea and drowned, leaving Daedalus to fly on
                  alone, devastated by his son's tragic fate. He eventually
                  reached Sicily, where he mourned Icarus and named the sea
                  where his son fell the Icarian Sea in his memory. [Unit-3;

                  One of the main advantages I see of Al in the classroom is
                  personalised learning. Al-powered educational tools can
                  analyse data on student performance and provide tailored
                  support to improve their grades. <br />
                  Al can also provide instant feedback. For example, Al-powered
                  educational tools can provide students with immediate feedback
                  on their work, allowing them to identify and correct mistakes
                  quickly. <br /> [Unit-1:Lesson-2(B)) <br />

                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  According to some myths and legends, Gazi Pir was a Muslim
                  saint who is said to have spread Islam in the parts of Bengal
                  close to the Sundarbans. He was credited with many miracles.
                  For example, he could supposedly calm dangerous animals and
                  make them docile. He is usually depicted in paats or scroll
                  paintings riding a fierce looking Bengal tiger, a snake in his
                  hand, but in no apparent danger. According to some stories, he
                  also fought crocodiles who threatened the people of the region
                  full of canals and creeks, indeed, a kind of watery jungle
                  bordering the Bay of Bengal. Because of his alert and vigilant
                  presence, all predatory animals were said to have been kept
                  within bounds. It was also believed that he enabled villagers
                  to live close to forests and jungles and cultivate their
                  lands. Consequently, people of these regions would pray to him
                  for protection. The story of Gazi Pir has been preserved in
                  folk literature as well as art and has been performed in
                  indigenous theatre. Some Gazir paat scrolls are part of the
                  collection of the British Museum. (Unit-3; Lesson-3(B))

                  <br />
                  2. Read the following text and make a flow chart showing the
                  multifarious features of Bangladeshi music. (No. 1 has been
                  done for you) 2 x 5 = 10 <br />
                  In Bangladesh folk music has great variety. with songs being
                  composed on the culture, festivals, views of life, natural
                  beauty, rivers and rural and riverine life. These songs are
                  also about social Inequality and poverty, about the material
                  world and the supernatural. Mystical songs have been composed
                  using the metaphors of rivers and boats. Since the country is
                  basically riverine, the Bhatiyall forms an important genre of
                  folk music. Folk music is formed and develops according to the
                  environment. Differences in the natural environment are
                  reflected in the people of the different regions. The dialects
                  too vary across the different regions. Bangladeshi folk music
                  therefore varies from region to region. Thus there are the
                  northern Bhawaiya, the eastern Bhatiyali and the southwestern
                  Baul songs. <br />
                  The culture and the lifestyle of the different tribes have
                  also influenced folk music. Tribes like the Santal, Garo,
                  Hajong, Chakma, Manipuri, Tripuri, Marma, etc. have interacted
                  with ethnic Bengali culture and lifestyle over the years. The
                  interaction has been clearly reflected in the richness of folk
                  music. [Unit-2: Lesson-2(B)]

                  Jodi borshe magher shesh, dhonyi rajar punyi desh. <br />
                  If it rains at the end of Magh (last month of Winter), the
                  kingdom will prosper. The mystery that connects seasons with
                  soil and crops with rain was no secret to her. She realized
                  the interdependence that links people and climate in myriad
                  ways. She was Khona. The mythical story of Khona is deeply
                  rooted in Bangla folklore. Khona, originally named Lila, was
                  an incredible woman with a gift for predicting weather and
                  understanding the ways of farming. Her wisdom was shared
                  through memorable, rhyming verses known as "Khona's Words" or
                  "Khonar Bochon." These sayings, though simple and easy to
                  remember, were filled with deep knowledge and practical advice
                  for farmers. <br />
                  Khona used her knowledge to help the peasants, but her actions
                  often challenged the ruling class. The rulers, not pleased
                  with her defiance, punished her cruelly by cutting out her
                  tongue. Thus, she became known as Khona, which means "someone
                  who cannot speak." Despite this harsh punishment, her wisdom
                  lived on through her sayings, which have been passed down for
                  over 1500 years. <br />
                  There are many versions of Khona's story. One retelling goes
                  like this: in the kingdom of Deyulnagar. there was a royal
                  astrologer named Varaha who served King Dharmaketu. Sadly,
                  Varaha's wife died while giving birth to their son. Mihir.
                  <br />
                  Worried about his son's future, Varaha saw in the stars that
                  Mihir was defined for a life of trouble and death.
                  Heartbroken, Varaha decided to save Mihir by placing him in a
                  copper pot and setting the pot afloat on the river
                  Viddyadhory. The baby was found and rescued in Sri Lanka,
                  where he was raised by the king. As he grew up in the royal
                  court, he married the king's daughter, an astrologer herself.
                  named Lila. <br />
                  Lila and Mihir managed to find Varaha and prove that his
                  predictions about Mihir's future had been wrong. Varaha,
                  though surprised by his mistake, was thrilled to see his son
                  again and welcomed both Mihir and Lila warmly. They were soon
                  introduced to the royal court and became royal astrologers
                  themselves. <br />
                  Even though Lila was now a royal astrologer, she kept in touch
                  with the local farmers. She learned a lot from them and found
                  that they shared valuable knowledge through short,
                  easy-to-remember verses. <br />
                  Lila began to use these simple verses to explain her own
                  complex astrological knowledge. Varaha, feeling jealous and
                  angry, ordered his son to punish Lila by cutting out her
                  tongue, hoping to silence her. However, Khona's story and her
                  knowledge remained alive. Her wisdom about nature-oriented
                  farming continued to benefit the people of the land. <br />

                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  The beginning of modern art practices in our country date from
                  1948, when the great artist Zainul Abedin (1914-1976), with
                  the help of some colleagues set up an institute of art in
                  Dhaka (now the Faculty of Fine Art, University of Dhaka). As
                  it began to offer art education, the institute drew together a
                  number of talented teachers and students who contributed to
                  the development of modern art almost from scratch. But within
                  a decade, artists were reflecting the most recent trends and
                  styles in their work - such as expressionism and abstract
                  expressionism- while maintaining a close contact with the
                  traditions of folk art. <br />
                  Zainul had earned all-India fame for his Famine Sketches, a
                  series of haunting sketches based on the Bengal famine of 1943
                  which took hundreds of thousands of lives. His watercolors,
                  scroll paintings and drawings inspire our artists even today.
                  The other prominent artists who had major contributions to the
                  spectacular rise of our contemporary art include Qamrul
                  Hassan, SM Sultan, Safiuddin Ahmed, Abdur Razzak, Qayyum
                  Chowdhury, Murtaza Baseer, Aminul Islam, Syed Jahangir, Debdas
                  Chakravarty, Novera Ahmed and Muhammad Kibria. <br />
                  The war of liberation and the independence of the country in
                  1971 inspired our artists to continue the efforts of the
                  earlier artists to explore the limits of art and create new
                  expressive modes. For the next four decades, art in our
                  country saw many experimentations. Artists dealt with new
                  ideas such as installation art and graphic art; and reshaped
                  older, traditional art forms. If you visit any art gallery or
                  art exhibition, you will find how our art reflects our
                  changing realities in fascinating and insightful ways. <br />

                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  The July Uprising was a mass movement in Bangladesh that led
                  to the overthrow of Sheikh Hasina's regime in July-August
                  2024. Also referred to as the 'Monsoon Revolution' or 'July
                  Revolution, the movement began with a student-led protest at
                  Dhaka University demanding quota reform in public service. The
                  government's brutal repression and the tragic loss of life
                  transformed the initially apolitical protest into a widespread
                  uprising that united various political, cultural, social, and
                  religious groups. This collective mobilization ultimately led
                  to Sheikh Hasina fleeing the country. The uprising was not a
                  sudden event, rather it was the culmination of 16 years of
                  public frustration stemming from tyranny. human rights abuses,
                  and the systematic dismantling of state institutions. The July
                  Uprising was fueled by a combination of long-standing
                  grievances and immediate triggers. <br />
                  <br />
                  Catalyst of the uprising: <br />
                  1. Quota Reform and Discrimination: The movement was ignited
                  by the reinstatement of a discriminatory quota system in
                  government jobs. The debate over quotas has a long history in
                  Bangladesh, with earlier protests in 1997, 2001, 2008, and
                  2013. The 2018 quota reform movement saw the government
                  announce the cancellation of the system, but its reinstatement
                  by the High The court in June 2024 sparked renewed student
                  protests. <br />
                  <br />
                  2. Political Repression and Fascist Rule: The 16-year rule of
                  the Awami League government was marked by political
                  repression, killings, enforced disappearances of opponents and
                  restrictions on freedom of expression. The politicization of
                  state institutions, from the judiciary and military to public
                  health and education, created deep-seated resentment among the
                  populace, who felt disenfranchised and oppressed. <br />
                  <br />
                  3. Electoral farce and disenfranchisement: For controlling
                  elections, Sheikh Hasina, bypassing Supreme Court direction,
                  removed the caretaker government system from the constitution
                  in 2011. Subsequent general elections of 2014, 2018 and 2024
                  held under the regime were widely marked by fraudulent
                  practices. Low voter turnout, widespread vote-rigging and a
                  controlled media environment eroded public faith in the
                  democratic process and left citizens feeling powerless. <br />
                  <br />
                  4. Economic Hardship: Rampant corruption, financial
                  mismanagement, and kleptocratic practices severely damaged the
                  country's economy. High unemployment, coupled with soaring
                  inflation and widening inequality, made life difficult for
                  ordinary citizens. Economic policies that favoured a select
                  few also marginalised small and medium-sized businesses,
                  contributing to widespread economic distress. <br />
                  <br />
                  5. Youth Disillusionment: Young people, particularly students,
                  were deeply disillusioned. They faced humiliation and violence
                  across the country from Chatra League terrorists and felt that
                  their merit and hard work were being ignored in favour of
                  nepotism and partisanship. particularly due to the extensive
                  quota system. <br />
                  <br />
                  6. Widespread Public Support: The uprising was largely
                  non-partisan and spontaneous. It garnered momentum because a
                  vast majority of citizens felt victimized by the government's
                  structural corruption, human rights abuses and Judicial
                  overreach. This shared experience of oppression meant that
                  when students took to the streets, the wider public quickly
                  joined them. <br />
                  <br />
                  7. Reaction to killings: The government's brutal response to
                  the protests which included attacks and killings of peaceful
                  demonstrators by security forces and political thugs, ignited
                  a furious public reaction. This violent repression was a
                  pivotal turning point, transforming the quota reform movement
                  into a nationwide anti-authoritarian uprising. <br />

                  Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  1. In 1921, Leela Nag (also known as Leela Roy for her
                  marriage with Anil Chandra Roy, an Indian National Congress
                  leader) was the first woman to be admitted to the M.A. in
                  English at the University of Dhaka. Breaking patriarchal
                  barriers, Leela Nag established the identity of the Department
                  of English from the very beginning as a platform for
                  progressive and liberal ideas. Although her decision to join
                  the Department of English was initially met with resistance,
                  she achieved her goal with a special permission from the then
                  Vice Chancellor Philip Hartog and fulfilled her dream of
                  graduating from the University of Dhaka. In 1923, she was the
                  first woman to receive an M.A. from the Department of English.
                  But Leela Nag's legacy goes beyond the confines of classrooms.
                  While she was a student, she formed the Dhaka Women's
                  Committee and raised funds for the 1921 Bengal flood victims.
                  She was actively involved in the empowerment of women in
                  society. In 1923, she founded Deepali Sangha which served as a
                  training institute for anti-colonial activists. Between 1927
                  and 1928, she established the first self-defense institute for
                  girls in Bengal. Then, at the 1928 Calcutta Congress Session,
                  she presented a paper on the history of women's movement in
                  Bengal as a delegate, and by 1929, Leela Nag had successfully
                  founded 12 free primary schools for girls. Apart from her
                  contribution to women's emancipation, Leela consistently
                  voiced her opinions in politics as well. She had been
                  imprisoned on several occasions. When the Subcontinent was
                  embroiled in turmoil during the Partition. Leela Nag set up
                  camps for victims of Noakhali riots in 1946, and for abandoned
                  women and refugees from East Bengal in 1947. In 1946, she was
                  the only Bengali woman elected to the Constituent Assembly of
                  Bengal. <br />
                  <br />
                  Leela Nag broke the glass ceiling on so many levels that it is
                  very difficult to limit her to being only a feminist. She
                  fulfills all the criteria of citizen, rebel, reformer, social
                  activist and a change agent. Looking at the other women who
                  studied in the Department of English much later, we can trace
                  these features of social activism in them as well. [Unit-4;

                  Early life <br />
                  Marie Curie nee Maria Sklodowska, was born in Warsaw on
                  November 7, 1867, the daughter of a secondary-school teacher.
                  From childhood she was remarkable for her prodigious memory,
                  and at the age of 16 she won a gold medal on completion of her
                  secondary education at the Russian lycee. Because her father,
                  a teacher of mathematics and physics, lost his savings through
                  bad investments. She had to take work as a teacher and, at the
                  same time, took part clandestinely in the nationalist "free
                  university." reading in Polish to women workers. At the age of
                  18 she took a post as governess. From her earnings she was
                  able to finance her sister Bronislawa's medical studies in
                  Paris, with the understanding that Bronislawa would in turn
                  later help her to get an education. <br />
                  Move to Paris, Pierre Curie, and first Nobel Prize <br />
                  <br />
                  In 1891. Sklodowska went to Paris and, now using the name
                  Marie, began to follow the lectures of Paul Appell. Gabriel
                  Lippmann. and Edmond Bouty at the Sorbonne. There she met many
                  physicists who were already well known. Sklodowska worked far
                  into the night in her student-quarters garret and virtually
                  lived on bread and butter and tea. She came first in the
                  licence examination of physical sciences in 1893. She began to
                  work in Lippmann's research laboratory and in 1894 was placed
                  second in the licence examination of mathematical sciences. It
                  was in the spring of that year that she met Pierre Curic.
                  <br />
                  Their marriage (July 25, 1895) marked the start of a
                  partnership that was soon to achieve results of world
                  significance, in particular the discovery of polontum (so
                  called by Marie in honour of her native land) in the summer of
                  1898 and that of radium a few months later. Following Henri
                  Becquerel's discovery (1896) of a new phenomenon (which she
                  later called "radioactivity"). Marie Curie, looking for a
                  subject for a thesis, decided to find out if the property
                  discovered in uranium was to be found in another matter. She
                  discovered that this was true for thorium at the same time as
                  G.C. Schmidt did. <br />
                  Turning her attention to minerals, she found her interest
                  drawn to pitchblende, a mineral whose activity, superior to
                  that of pure uranium, could be explained only by the presence
                  in the ore of small quantities of an unknown substance of very
                  high activity. Pierre Curie then joined her in the work that
                  she had undertaken to resolve this problem and that led to the
                  discovery of the new elements. polonium and radium. While
                  Pierre Curie devoted himself chiefly to the physical study of
                  the new radiations, Marie Curie struggled to obtain pure
                  radium in the metallic state-achieved with the help of the
                  chemist Andre-Louis Debierne, one of Pierre Curie's pupils. On
                  the results of this research, Marie Curle received her
                  doctorate of science in June 1903 and. with Pierre, was
                  awarded the Davy Medal of the Royal Society. Also, in 1903,
                  they shared with Becquerel the Nobel Prize for Physics for the
                  discovery of radioactivity. [Unit 4: Lesson-3(A) <br />

                  folk music. (No. 1 has been done for you) 2 x 5 = 10 <br />
                  Folk music may be described as the music of the ancient times
                  that sprang from the heart of a community, based on their
                  natural style of expression uninfluenced by the rules of
                  classical music or modern popular songs. Any arrangement of
                  sound created by the combination of tune, voice and
                  instrument/dance may be described as music. Folk music is the
                  combination of song, tune and dance that originate from the
                  traditional culture of ordinary people (the folk). For
                  example, Baul songs are a combination of tune, music and dance
                  that are associated with the Baul tradition in Bengal. In
                  Bangladesh folk music has great variety, with songs being
                  composed on the culture, festivals, views of life, natural
                  beauty, rivers and rural and riverine life. These songs are
                  also about social inequality and poverty, about the material
                  world and the supernatural. Mystical songs have been composed
                  using the metaphors of rivers and boats. Since the country is
                  basically riverine, the Bhatiyali forms an important genre of
                  folk music. Nature plays a role in providing the content and
                  rhythm of folk music. The folk music of Bangladesh varies from
                  region to region reflecting changes in the natural environment
                  and the dialects people use. Thus there are the northern
                  Bhawaiya, the eastern Bhatiyali and the southwestern Baul
                  songs.[Unit-2; Lesson-2(B))] <br />

                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  Nishat Mazumder, a Bangladeshi woman in her early forties, is
                  a sports icon. She comes of a modest background; her father is
                  a businessman and her mother is a housewife. She is the second
                  of four siblings. Nishat has three things that she can be
                  proud of. These are: she has extraordinarily supportive
                  parents who accepted her dreams as real; her father was a
                  freedom fighter in the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971.
                  and she scaled the highest peak in the world as the first
                  Bangladeshi girl in 2012. Nishat's life presents an
                  inspirational story that the youth in Bangladesh needs to
                  know. <br />
                  Nishat was born on 5 January 1981 in a village called Teori,
                  which is situated in Ramganj upazila in Lakshmipur District.
                  She completed her schooling from Bottomley Home Girls' High
                  School in 1997, and passed HSC from Shahid Anwar Girls'
                  College in 1999. She earned her bachelor's and master's
                  degrees in Accounting from Dhaka City College, and currently
                  works for Dhaka WASA as an accountant. She is also interested
                  in different languages and cultures of the world, and has
                  enrolled for her MA in Japan Studies at Dhaka University. For
                  us. Nishat's life comes across as especially significant
                  because it tells us how the influence of one person can
                  motivate someone to dream big. As the daughter of a freedom
                  fighter, Nishat had to face many obstacles in her life, but
                  her mother, her role model, gave her courage and determination
                  to overcome them and pursue her dreams. Ashura Mazumder,
                  Nishat's mother, is a hardworking and understanding woman, who
                  has been a pillar of support for her family in the direst of
                  situations. Nishat learned from her mother how to keep mental
                  strength in calamitous moments of life. Learning from her.
                  Nishat began her dream of conquering mountains. <br />

                  2. Read the following text and make a flow chart showing the
                  conditions of adolescent girls in Bangladesh. (one is done for
                  you) 2 x 5= 10 <br />
                  When adolescent girls are pulled out of school, either for
                  marriage or work, they often lose their mobility, their
                  friends and social status. The lack of mobility among
                  adolescent girls also curtails their economic and non-formal
                  educational opportunities. Moreover, they lack information
                  about health issues. According to a study, only about three in
                  five adolescents have even heard of HIV. It is also reported
                  that more than 50 percent of adolescent girls are
                  undernourished and suffer from anaemia. Adolescent fertility
                  is also high in Bangladesh. The contribution of the adolescent
                  fertility rate to the total fertility rate increased from
                  20.3% in 1993 to 24.4% in 2007. Moreover, neonatal mortality
                  is another concern for younger mothers. <br /> [Unit-9;

                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  The success of Kalsindur girls reads like an epic. They
                  started their journey with practically nothing. They didn't
                  have any boots or jerseys to wear. Initially, they played
                  wearing salwar and kamij. They also suffered from
                  malnutrition. What made them win against all adversities then?
                  What was the magic behind? Mohammad Mafiz Uddin was an
                  assistant teacher at Kalsindur Government Free Primary School
                  where Minati Rani Sheel was the head teacher. They observed
                  the girls' interests in football and decided to help. It was
                  however not that easy. Girls playing football is still not a
                  common picture in Bangladesh. Guardians were not convinced as
                  they were used to seeing girls helping mothers with household
                  chores. A farmer, an auto-rickshaw driver, a tea-shop owner or
                  a housemaid mother couldn't be that ambitious either. But
                  Minati Rani Sheel and Mohammad Mafiz Uddin persuaded them to
                  allow their daughters to play. Being great motivators, the two
                  teachers supported the girls in their effort to overcome the
                  odds. They inspired them, created opportunities for them and
                  took personal care of them. Soon the girls could prove
                  themselves, shaking off their inhibition. Their success has
                  also persuaded the villagers to come to their support. <br />
                  When the girls moved to the nearby secondary school and
                  college, they did not have their Minati Maam and Mafiz Uddin
                  Str with them, but soon another motherly person offered her
                  helping hand- Mala Rani Sarkar, an Assistant Professor of
                  History- who was joined by one of her colleagues. Juel Mia.
                  They agreed to coach the girls. Mr Jalaluddin, who was then
                  the head teacher of the school, also supported them. Gradually
                  the local community, public representatives and the local
                  administration came forward. Bangladesh Football Federation
                  also gave special attention to them and finally another
                  football magician, Golam Robbani Choton, the coach of the
                  Bangladesh Women's National Football Team, mentored these
                  girls and helped them become complete professional
                  footballers. <br /> [(Unit-7: Lesson-3(B))]

                  (No. 1 has been done for you) 2 x 5= 10 <br />
                  For a moment, finding that he had a mother shocked me... I did
                  not know why it disturbed me. Then I understood my distress. I
                  was filled with a passionate resentment that any woman should
                  go away and leave her son.... A son like this one The
                  orphanage was a wholesome place, the food was more than
                  adequate, the boys were healthy.... Granted. Perhaps, that the
                  boy felt no lack, what blood fed the bowels of a woman who did
                  not yearn over this child's lean body that had come in
                  parturition out of her own? <br />
                  <br />
                  "Have you seen her, Jerry lately?" I asked. <br />
                  <br />
                  "I see her every summer. She sent it to me." <br />
                  <br />I wanted to cry out. "Why are you not with her? How can
                  she let you go away again?" He said. "She comes up here from
                  Mannville whenever she can. She doesn't have a job now." His
                  face shone in the firelight. "She wanted to give me a puppy,
                  but they can't let any one boy keep a puppy. You remember the
                  suit I had last Sunday?" He was plainly proud. "She sent me
                  that for Christmas. The Christmas before that he drew a long
                  breath, savoring the memory "she sent me a pair of skates....
                  I let the other boys use them, but they're careful of them."

                  PART-A: READING TEST (60 Marks) <br />
                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  The famous Greek philosopher Aristotle said, Man is by nature
                  a social animal. What he meant was that man, by instinct,
                  seeks company of others and establishes relationships, much
                  like most animals of the wild, for companionship and for
                  physical and emotional support. Unlike the animals however.
                  man's relationships give meaning to his existence and inspires
                  him to do well in education, in workplace or in a profession
                  that he pursues. <br />
                  Relationships are of different kinds. Some are familial and
                  intimate, formed by blood and by marriage: some are social
                  like the ones we have with friends and some are made in school
                  where we form close bonds with classmates and teachers.
                  Relationships can also be fostered in workplace, which may
                  quickly change from professional to social. There are
                  relationships also between human beings and animals, between
                  children and their toys that they cannot part with. <br />
                  All these relationships keep us close to each other and
                  provide us all kinds of support, love and affection. A person
                  who has no family feels the pain of loneliness and isolation.
                  There is no one to laugh or cry with him/her. When we share
                  our joy with someone, it simply redoubles, and when we suffer
                  a loss and someone shares our sorrow. It lessens.
                  Relationships are thus needed for our emotional health. <br />
                  To build relationships, we need to have trust and respect for
                  each other, and love where this is needed. We cannot be
                  selfish and possessive if we want to establish an effective
                  relationship. But quite often we see people quarrelling and
                  fighting with each other which only brings misery and loss to
                  all. <br /> [Unit-8; Lesson-1(B)] <br />

                  60% of them become mothers by the time they reach 19. When an
                  adolescent girl gets married, she usually drops out of school
                  and thus loses her mobility. <br />
                  She gets confined to full-time work in her in-law's household.
                  She loses social status and all the opportunities of economic
                  independence. In her in-law's house, she gets marginalized.
                  She becomes vulnerable to all sorts of abuse, including
                  dowry-related violence. In our country, it is still a common
                  practice for the bride's family to pay dowry. Dowry demands
                  can continue even after marriage. An adolescent bride, even if
                  her in-laws are supportive. faces enormous health risk during
                  pregnancy and child birth. Majority of our people are
                  uninformed or insufficiently informed about contraception and
                  reproductive health. This leads to increased mortality rates
                  among adolescent brides during childbirth. <br /> (Unit-9,

                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  At daylight I was half awakened by the sound of chopping.
                  Again it was so even in texture that I went back to sleep.
                  When I left my bed in the cool morning, the boy had come and
                  gone, and a stack of kindling was neat against the cabin wall.
                  He came after school in the afternoon and worked until time to
                  return to the orphanage. His name was Jerry... he had been at
                  the orphanage since he was four. I could picture him at four,
                  with the same grave gray-blue eyes and the same independence?
                  No, the word that comes to me is "integrity".... It is bedded
                  on courage, but it is more than brave. It is honest. but it is
                  more than honesty. The ax handle broke one day. Jerry said the
                  woodshop at the orphanage would repair it. I brought money to
                  pay for the job and he refused it. "Ill pay for it," he said.
                  "1 broke it. I brought the ax down careless." "But no one hits
                  accurately every time. I told him. "The fault was in the wood
                  of the handle. I'll see the man from whom I bought it It was
                  only then that he would take the money. He was standing back
                  of his own carelessness. He was a free-will agent and he chose
                  to do careful work, and if he failed, he took the
                  responsibility without subterfuge. And he did for me the
                  unnecessary thing, the gracious thing that we find done only
                  by the great of heart. Things no training can teach, for they
                  arte done on the instant, with no predicated experience. He
                  found a cubbyhole beside the fireplace that I had not noticed.
                  There, of his own accord, he put kindling and "medium" wood,
                  so that I might always have dry fire material ready in case of
                  sudden wet weather. A stone was loose in the rough walk to the
                  cabin. He dug a deeper hole and steadied it, although he came,
                  himself. by a shortcut over the bank. I found that when I
                  tried to return his thoughtfulness with such things as candy
                  and apples, he was wordless. "Thank you" was, perhaps, an
                  expression for which he had had no use, for his courtesy was
                  instinctive. He only looked at the gift and at me, and a
                  curtain lifted, so that I saw deep into the clear well of his
                  eyes, and gratitude was there, and affection, soft over the
                  firm granite of his character.... (Unit-8; Lesson-3(C)) <br />

                  2. Read the text and make a flow-chart showing the different
                  types of dreams. (one is done for you) 2 x 5 = 10 <br />
                  Dreams have fascinated philosophers for thousands of years,
                  but only recently have dreams been subjected to empirical
                  research and scientific study. Chances are that you've often
                  found yourself puzzling over the content of a dream, or
                  perhaps you've wondered why you dream at all. First, let's
                  start by answering a basic question: What is a dream? A dream
                  can include any of the images, thoughts and emotions that are
                  experienced during sleep. Dreams can be extraordinarily vivid
                  or very vague; filled with joyful emotions or frightening
                  images; focused and understandable or unclear and confusing.
                  <br />
                  Why do we dream? What purpose do dreams serve? While many
                  theories have been proposed about the reason and function of
                  dreams, no consensus has emerged. Considering the time we
                  spend in a dreaming state, the fact that researchers do not
                  yet understand the purpose of dreams may seem baffling.
                  However, it is important to consider that science is still
                  unraveling the exact purpose and function of sleep itself.
                  Some researchers suggest that dreams serve no real purpose,
                  while others believe that dreaming is essential to mental,
                  emotional and physical well-being. Next, let's learn more
                  about some of the most prominent dream theories. Consistent
                  with the psychoanalytic perspective, Sigmund Freud's theory of
                  dreams suggests that dreams are a representation of
                  unconscious desires, thoughts and motivations. According to
                  Freud, people are driven by aggressive and sexual instincts
                  that are repressed from conscious awareness. While these
                  thoughts are not consciously expressed, they find their way
                  into our awareness via dreams. In his famous book The
                  Interpretation of Dreams, Freud wrote that dreams are
                  '...disguised fulfillments of repressed wishes.' Freud's
                  theory contributed to the popularity of dream interpretation.

                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  He came every day and cut my wood and did small helpful favors
                  and stayed to talk. The days had become cold, and often I let
                  him come inside the cabin. He would lie on the floor in front
                  of the fire, with one arm across the pointer, and they would
                  both doze and wait quietly for me. Other days they ran with a
                  common ecstasy through the laurel, and he brought me back
                  vermilion maple leaves, and chestnut boughs dripping with
                  imperial yellow. I was ready to go. <br />
                  I said to him, “You have been my friend, Jerry. I shall often
                  think of you and miss you. Pat will miss you too. I am leaving
                  tomorrow." <br />
                  He did not answer... and I watched him go in silence up the
                  hill. <br />
                  I expected him the next day, but he did not come... I closed
                  the cabin and started the car... I stopped by the orphanage
                  and left the cabin key and money... with Miss Clark. "And will
                  you call Jerry for me to say good-bye to him?" <br />
                  "I don't know where he is," she said. "I'm afraid he's not
                  well. He didn't eat his dinner this noon. One of the other
                  boys saw him going over the hill into the laurel... It's not
                  like him"... <br />
                  I was almost relieved... It would be easier not to say
                  good-bye to him.... <br />
                  I said, "I wanted to talk with you about his mother why he's
                  here but I'm in more of a hurry than I expected to be. It's
                  out of the question for me to see her now, too. But here's
                  some money... to buy things for him at Christmas and on his
                  birthday. It will be better for me to try to send him things.
                  I could easily duplicate skates, for instance." She blinked
                  her honest spinster's eyes. "There's not much use for skates
                  here," she said. Her stupidity annoyed me. "What I mean." I
                  said, "Is that I don't want to duplicate the things his mother
                  sends him. I might have chosen skates if I didn't know she had
                  already given them to him." <br />
                  She stared at me. <br />
                  "I don't understand," she said. "He has no mother. He has no
                  skates." <br /> [Unit-8; Lesson-3(C)] <br />

                  PART-A: READING TEST [60 Marks] <br />
                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  Children must pass through several stages in their lives to
                  become adults. For most people, there are four or five such
                  stages of growth where they learn certain things: infancy
                  (birth to age 2), early childhood (3 to 8 years), later
                  childhood (9 to 12 years) and adolescence (13 to 18 years).
                  Persons 18 and over are considered adults in our society. Of
                  course, there are some who will try to act older than their
                  years. But, for the most part, most individuals have to go
                  through these stages irrespective of their economic or social
                  status. <br />
                  The World Health Organisation (WHO) identifies adolescence as
                  the period in human growth and development that occurs after
                  childhood and before adulthood. This phase represents one of
                  the critical transitions in one's life span and is
                  characterised by fast-paced growth and change which are second
                  only to those at infancy. Biological processes drive many
                  aspects of this growth and development with the onset of
                  puberty marking the passage from childhood to adolescence. The
                  biological determinants of adolescence are fairly universal;
                  however, the duration and defining characteristics of this
                  period may vary across time, cultures, and socio-economic
                  situations. This period has seen many changes over the past
                  century-puberty, for example, comes earlier than before,
                  people marry late, and their sexual attitudes and behaviours
                  are different from their grandparents, or even parents. Among
                  the factors responsible for the change are education,
                  urbanization and spread of global communication. The time of
                  adolescence is a period of preparation for adulthood during
                  which one experiences several key developments. Besides
                  physical and sexual maturation, these experiences include
                  movement toward social and economic independence, development
                  of identity, the acquisition of skills needed to carry out
                  adult relationships and roles and the capacity for abstract
                  reasoning. While adolescence is a time of tremendous growth
                  and potential, it is also a time of considerable risks during
                  which social contexts exert powerful influences. <br />

                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  Adolescents constitute a nation's core resource for national
                  renewal and growth. Adolescence is a period in life when
                  transition from childhood to adulthood takes place and
                  behaviours and life styles are shaped. According to the World
                  Health Organisation (WHO), adolescence is the period which
                  shapes the future of girls and boys' lives. There are more
                  than 31 million adolescents in Bangladesh: 13.7 million of
                  them are girls and 14.3 million boys. <br />
                  The situation of adolescent girls in Bangladesh is
                  characterised by inequality and subordination within the
                  family and society. This inequality leads to widespread
                  practice of child marriage, marginalisation or exclusion from
                  health, education and economic opportunities, and
                  vulnerability to violence and sexual abuse. <br />
                  In Bangladesh, the legal age of marriage is 18 for girls and
                  21 for boys. However, 33 percent of adolescent girls are
                  married before the age of 15 and 60 percent become mothers by
                  the age of 19. Research finds that adolescents with higher
                  levels of education and from more affluent families tend to
                  marry at a later age. Boys, however, become ready for marriage
                  only after several years of adolescence and young adulthood.

                  iv. having sympathy for others <br />

                  <br />

                  Jerry's activities at the writer's cabin. (No. 1 has been done
                  for you) <br />
                  He came every day and cut my wood and did small helpful favors
                  and stayed to talk. The days had become cold, and often I let
                  him come inside the cabin. He would lie on the floor in front
                  of the fire. C with one arm across the pointer, and they would
                  both doze and wait quietly for me. Other days they ran with a
                  common ecstasy through the laurel, and he brought me back
                  vermilion maple leaves, and chestnut boughs dripping with
                  Imperial yellow. I was ready to go. <br />
                  I said to him, "You have been my friend, Jerry. I shall often
                  think of you and miss you. Pat will miss you too. I am leaving
                  tomorrow." <br />
                  He did not answer... and I watched him go in silence up the
                  hill. <br />
                  I expected him the next day, but he did not come... I closed
                  the cabin and started the car... I stopped by the orphanage
                  and left the cabin key and money... with Miss Clark. "And will
                  you call Jerry for me to say good-bye to him?" <br /> [Unit-8:

                  PART-A: READING TEST [60 Marks] <br />
                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  When a girl gets married, she usually drops out of school and
                  begins full-time work in her in- laws' household. In the
                  in-laws' house, she is marginalized. She becomes vulnerable to
                  all forms of abuse. Including dowry-related violence. In
                  Bangladesh, it is still common for a bride's family to pay
                  dowry. despite the practice being illegal. Dowry demands can
                  also continue after the wedding. For an adolescent bride, even
                  if her in-laws are supportive, there are greater health risks
                  in terms of pregnancy and child birth. The majority of
                  adolescent brides and their families are uninformed or
                  Insufficiently informed about reproductive health and
                  contraception. The maternal mortality rate for adolescents is
                  double the national rate. <br />
                  When adolescent girls are pulled out of school, either for
                  marriage or work, they often lose their mobility, their
                  friends and social status. The lack of mobility among
                  adolescent girls also curtails their economic and non-formal
                  educational opportunities. Moreover, they lack information
                  about health issues. According to a study, only about three in
                  five adolescents have even heard of HIV. It is also reported
                  that more than 50 percent of adolescent girls are
                  undernourished and suffer from anaemia. Adolescent fertility
                  is also high in Bangladesh. The contribution of the adolescent
                  fertility rate to the total fertility rate Increased from
                  20.3% in 1993 to 24.4% in 2007. Moreover, neonatal mortality
                  is another concern for younger mothers. <br />
                  While the situation for adolescent boys is somewhat better,
                  many are vulnerable and lack the power to make decisions about
                  their own lives. Many boys who are unable to go to school, or
                  are unemployed. remain unaware of social or health issues.
                  They are at considerable risk of being drawn into criminal
                  activities. They are also more likely to get exposed to drugs
                  and alcohol. <br />

                  The TELEPHONE RANG and the voice at the other end said,
                  "Shaykh Muharram, your teacher,speaking." I answered politely
                  with a reverent air, "My mentor is most welcome." <br />
                  "I'm coming to visit you," he said. <br />
                  "Looking forward to receiving you," I replied. <br />
                  I felt not the slightest astonishment-though I had walked in
                  his funeral procession some sixty years before. A host of
                  indelible memories came back to me about my old instructor. I
                  remembered his handsome face and his elegant clothes-and the
                  extreme harshness with which he treated his pupils. The shaykh
                  showed up with his lustrous jubba and caftan, and his
                  spiraling turban, saying without prologue, "Over there, I have
                  dwelt with many reciters of ancient verse, as well as experts
                  in religion. After talking with them, I realized that some of
                  the lessons I used to give you were in need of correction. I
                  have written the corrections on this paper I have brought

                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  In Bangladesh, 35 percent students aged between 13 and 15
                  reported being bullied one or more days in 30 days or involved
                  in a physical fight at least once in 12 months in 2014, says a
                  new report. Globally, half of students aged between 13 and 15
                  worldwide around 150 million report having experienced
                  peer-to-peer violence such as physical fights or forms of
                  bullying, from their peers in and around school, according to
                  the report released by UNICEF. <br />
                  <br />
                  The report is based on data from the Health Behaviour in
                  School-aged Children: Cross-national Study and the Global
                  School-based Student Health Surveys. The data include 122
                  countries, representing 51 percent of the global population of
                  children between 13 and 15. <br />
                  <br />
                  The report finds that students experience other forms of
                  violence at school, such as attacks in classrooms or physical
                  punishment by teachers, About 720 million school-age children
                  live in countries where they are not fully protected by law
                  against forms of physical punishment at school, according to
                  the report. <br />
                  "Education is the key to building peaceful societies, and yet,
                  for millions of children around the world, school itself is
                  not safe," said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore.
                  "Every day, students face multiple dangers, including
                  fighting. pressure to join gangs, bullying both in person and
                  online. discipline, sexual harassment and armed violence. In
                  the short-term this impacts their learning. violent
                  discipline. and in the long-term it can lead to depression,
                  anxiety and even suicide. Violence is an unforgettable <br />
                  lesson that no child needs to learn." <br />
                  Globally, slightly more than one in three students between 13
                  and 15 said they experience bullying. according to the report.
                  About one in three has been involved in physical fights. On
                  the other hand, 17 million young adolescents in 39
                  industrialised countries have admitted bullying others at
                  school, according to the report. While girls and boys are
                  equally at risk of bullying, girls are more likely to become
                  victims of psychological forms of bullying and boys are more
                  at risk of physical violence and threats. <br />
                  The report notes that violence involving weapons in schools,
                  such as knives and guns, continues to claim lives. It also
                  says that in an increasingly digital world, bullies are
                  disseminating violent,. hurtful and <br />
                  humiliating content with the click of a button. <br />

                  college, they did not have their Minati Maam and Mafiz Uddin
                  Sir with them, but soon another motherly person offered her
                  helping hand-Mala Rani Sarkar, an Assistant Professor of
                  History- who was joined by one of her colleagues, Juel Mia.
                  They agreed to coach the girls. Mr Jalaluddin, who was then
                  the head teacher of the school. also supported them. Gradually
                  the local community, public representatives and the local

                  PART-A: READING TEST [60 Marks] <br />
                  1.Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  We spend money for different reasons. We buy food, clothes or
                  everyday essentials, pay for different services, entertain
                  people, travel to places, help others in need or invest in
                  business and thus spend money every day. In fact, spending is
                  a part of our life. Spending may make us happy or unhappy
                  depending on how and why we spend. When we spend money on
                  things that we need and within our limit, it is good. When it
                  becomes a compulsive behaviour, it makes life stressful.
                  Unnecessary spending or spending beyond one's means has some
                  bad effects. For one thing, it may lead to financial ruin or
                  debt, and for another, it may create unhappiness within
                  families. People who overspend are never satisfied with what
                  they have. They always rush for brands, fashion items,
                  designer clothes etc. Over a period of time it becomes an
                  addiction which may eventually create psychological problems.
                  <br />
                  Nowadays consumer items are displayed in stores or in
                  advertisements in ways that they create a feeling of immediate
                  need for them. We are constantly tempted to buy, use or
                  consume things even when we do not have a genuine need. We all
                  need to be careful here. Salespersons often encourage
                  customers to buy things by flattering them. This is a perfect
                  match for you, they would say, or You look so stunning in that
                  dress. Never forget, they say the same thing to most of their
                  customers. It is better not to be persuaded by such words.
                  They use these words to please the customers as the more a
                  customer buys, the higher the profit is. Overspending is not
                  only related to shopping, it applies to other activities as
                  well such as eating out. Many people buy too many items to eat
                  in a restaurant. They can eat only some of them and the rest
                  are wasted. It's not a responsible attitude. We cannot simply
                  waste food because we have money to buy it. <br />
                  <br />
                  Young people in a shopping mall often look at an item on
                  display and think 'Oh I must buy this. I really need this.
                  They may not have the money needed in their wallet. So they
                  use credit cards but using them is like taking a loan. If they
                  are not careful, the loans increase which might lead them to a
                  debt-trap. Sometimes children insist on buying things that
                  their parents cannot pay for without stretching their budget.
                  This may happen because the children's friends also have them.
                  It's not fair as it becomes a burden for the parents. <br />

                  PART-A: READING TEST [60 Marks] <br />
                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  One of the sources of water in our country is the rivers.
                  Rivers are everywhere in our life, literature, economy and
                  culture. But are the rivers in good shape? Unfortunately, they
                  are not. A few are already dead and several are going through
                  the pangs of death. The river Buriganga is an example of a
                  dying river. A report published in the Daily Sun describes
                  what has happened to the river Buriganga and why. Its water is
                  polluted and a perpetual stench fills the air around it. But
                  that is not what it was like before. The report says that the
                  river had a glorious past. Once it was a tributary of the
                  mighty Ganges and flowed into the Bay of Bengal through the
                  river Dhaleshwari. Gradually, it lost its link with the Ganges
                  and got the name Buriganga. The Mughals were marveled at the
                  tide level of the Buriganga and founded their capital
                  Jahangirnagar on its banks in 1610. The river supplied
                  drinking water and supported trade and commerce. Jahangirnagar
                  was renamed Dhaka which grew into a heavily populated city
                  with a chronic shortage of space. <br />
                  The city paid back the bounty of the river by sucking life out
                  of it! According to a newspaper report, the Buriganga is dying
                  because of pollution. Huge quantities of toxic chemicals and
                  wastes from mills and factories, hospitals and clinics and
                  households and other establishments are dumped into the river
                  every day. The city of Dhaka discharges about 4500 tons of
                  solid waste every day and most of it is directly released into
                  the Buriganga. According to the Department of the Environment
                  (DoE), 20.000 tons of tannery waste, including some highly
                  toxic materials, are released into the river every day.
                  Experts identified nine industrial areas in and around the
                  capital city as the primary sources of river pollution: Tongi,
                  Tejgaon, Hazaribagh, Tarabo, Narayanganj, Savar, Gazipur,
                  Dhaka Export Processing Zone and Ghorashal. <br />
                  The river would need a monster's stomach to digest all the
                  wastes mentioned above. There is a limit up to which it can
                  put up with its cruel and thoughtless treatment. We humans
                  have successfully killed one of our rivers. There are other
                  rivers in the country that are being subjected to similar
                  thoughtless treatment. Unless we take care of our rivers there
                  may come a time when we will cry 'water, water and find it
                  nowhere. <br /> [Unit-12: Lesson-1(B)] <br />

                  to 'literature' as they <br />
                  i. are being polluted <br />
                  ii. are a very important source of water <br />

                  (b) What will happen to us unless we take care of our rivers

                  (c) What did the Mughals marvel at? What was the outcome of
                  it? <br />

                  (e) "There are other rivers in the country that are being
                  subjected to similar thoughtless treatment." Do you agree?
                  Give reasons for your answer. <br />
                  <br />
                  2. Based on your reading of the passage, make short notes in
                  each of the boxes in the flow-chart showing the cooking and
                  serving process of the stuffed cucumber dish. (No. 1 has been
                  done for you.) 2×5=10 <br />
                  Two cucumbers were served. After pressing them a little with a
                  fork, the polau came out. The polau was mixed with small
                  pieces of meat (what we call keema), slices of tomato and
                  grated country cheese. I realised that all the stuffings had
                  been put inside the boiled cucumber and finally it was fried
                  in ghee. The same principle as our dolma of fish and potol-the
                  only difference was here they had stuffed the cucumber with
                  polau, meat, tomato and cheese. Thus this was a truly
                  superlative creation. <br />

                  and "medium" wood, so that I might always have dry fire
                  material ready in case of sudden wet weather. A stone was
                  loose in the rough walk to the cabin. He d ug a deeper hole
                  and steadied it, although he came, himself, by a shortcut over
                  the bank. I found that when I tried to return his
                  thoughtfulness with such things as candy and apples, he was
                  wordless. "Thai nk you" was, perhaps, an expression for which
                  he had had no use, for his courtesy was instinctive. He o nly
                  looked at the gift and at me, and a curtain lifted, so that I
                  saw deep into the clear well of his eyes, ar id gratitude was
                  there, and affection, soft over the firm granite of his
                  character.... <br />
                  He became intimate, of course, with my pointer, Pat. There is
                  a strange communion between a boy and a dog. Perhaps they
                  possess the same singleness of spirit, the same kind of
                  wisdom. It is difficult to explain, but it exists. When I went
                  across the state for a weekend, I left the dog in Jerry's
                  charge.... My return was belated and fog filled the mountain
                  passes so treacherously that.... <br />
                  it was Monday noon before I reached the cabin. The dog had
                  been fed and cared for that morning. Jerry came early in the
                  afternoon, anxious. <br />

                  Many adolescents face pressure to use alcohol, cigarettes, or
                  other drugs and to initiate sexual relationships putting
                  themselves at high risk for intentional and unintentional
                  injuries, unintended pregnancies, and sexually transmitted
                  infections (STIs), including the human immunodeficiency virus
                  (HIV). Many also experience a wide range of adjustment and
                  mental health problems. Behaviour patterns that are
                  established during this period such as the use or avoidance of
                  drugs and taking or abstaining from sexual risk can have
                  long-lasting negative and positive effects on future health
                  and well-being. As a result, adults have unique opportunities
                  to influence adolescents. <br />
                  Adolescents are different both from young children and adults.
                  Specifically, adolescents are not fully capable of
                  understanding complex concepts, or the relationship between
                  behaviour and consequences, or the degree of control they have
                  or can have over health decision-making, including that
                  related to sexual behaviour. This inability may make them
                  particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation and high-risk
                  behaviours. Laws, customs, and practices may also affect
                  adolescents differently than adults. For example, laws and
                  policies often restrict adolescents' access to reproductive
                  health information and services, especially when they are
                  unmarried. In addition, even when services do exist, provider
                  attitudes about adolescents often pose a significant barrier
                  to the use of those services. <br />
                  Adolescents depend on their families, their communities,
                  schools, health services and their workplaces to learn a wide
                  range of skills that can help them to cope with the pressures
                  they face and make a successful transition from childhood to
                  adulthood. Parents, members of the community, service
                  providers, and social institutions have the responsibility to
                  both promote adolescent development and adjustment and to
                  intervene effectively when problems arise. <br />

                  Syed Mujtaba Ali, was an acclaimed Bengali author, academic
                  and linguist. He was a travel enthusiast and his travelogues
                  are regarded as precious gems in our Bangla literature. At
                  some point of time between the two World Wars, Syed Mujtaba
                  Ali set out on a ship from India on a journey to Europe.
                  Leaving Sri Lanka behind, he sailed across the Arabian Sea,
                  then along the coast of Africa, before reaching the Suez Port.
                  Syed Mujtaba Ali's time in Egypt was punctuated by a number of
                  funny anecdotes, both about the people and the pyramids. The
                  following excerpt is from Syed Mujtaba Ali's travelogue, Tales
                  of a Voyager (Jolay Dangay) where he gives a charming and
                  insightful description of Egyptian food and language. Nazes
                  Afroz translates the following excerpt. <br />
                  Our Bengali meals consist of five flavours of food-bitter,
                  savoury, hot, sour sides and desserts. The English eat only
                  sweet and savoury preparations. They cannot stomach the hot
                  stuff, and even less the sour. And possibly never even know
                  that bitters could be consumed. Hence English cuisine seems
                  bland and tasteless to us. But the English can bake good
                  cake-pastry-pudding, something they learned from the Italians.
                  In my opinion, our sandesh and rasogolla are such delicacies
                  that there is no reason to go bananas over those desserts.
                  <br />
                  Egyptian cuisine is a close cousin of Indian food of the
                  Mughlai variety. I might not be able to prove the theory but
                  after taking food in many countries, it is my firm belief that
                  imitating the Taj Mahal of cooking, that the Mughals perfected
                  after coming to India (one should not forget that they could
                  not master it in their own land as the Indian spices were
                  unavailable in their motherland of Turkestan), the people in
                  Afghanistan, Iran, the Arab land, Egypt, even Spain, have been
                  trying to build their own little Taj of cuisine. The reach of
                  this gastronomy has spread to East Europe's Greece, Hungary,
                  Rumania, Yugoslavia, Albania and even Italy. <br />

                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  Like many other South Asian countries, in Bangladesh, the
                  gravity of sexual harassment in public. space has been diluted
                  and almost "normalised" through calling it 'eve-teasing'. 'Eve
                  teasing is just another term for sexual harassment in public
                  space or street harassment in Bangladesh and other South Asian
                  countries. By using a benign word such as 'teasing' to express
                  a behaviour that is grossly inappropriate, it reduces the
                  extent of the action, therefore, we should use the word sexual
                  harassment instead of "eve-teasing" in order to address this
                  deep seated problem of our society. Although late,
                  policymakers in Bangladesh are also finally realising that
                  eve-teasing constitutes sexual harassment. There is no
                  estimate on national prevalence of sexual harassment in public
                  spaces in Bangladesh. <br />
                  A 2015 survey by ActionAid, an intenrational non-governmental
                  organisation, found that 84% of 800 women and girls reported
                  experiencing sexual harassment in public places. <br />
                  According to Ain O Salish Kendra (ASK), a legal aid
                  organisation. 108 women were sexually harassed in Bangladesh
                  between January and October 2018, of which eight women
                  attempted suicide, and seven men were murdered when they
                  protested these harassments. <br />
                  To allow social change regarding sexual harassment to take
                  place in Bangladesh, it is imperative that we as a society
                  listen more to the survivors, rather than blaming them.
                  Starting from school-level interventions, public and private
                  stakeholders must immediately begin to reframe the messaging
                  around socialization of boys and girls and stop the
                  propagation of stereotypical mind-set from parents. teachers
                  and community to their children. <br />

                  2 Read the following text and make a flow chart showing
                  activities commonly considered as poor dining etiquette. (No.
                  1 has been done for you) 2 x 5 = 10 <br />
                  People are usually disgusted when you're eating with a person
                  chomping and slurping and burping and splattering. Because of
                  that, table manners have always been a good 'tell' about
                  someone's overall refinement, their upbringing, and
                  self-awareness around other people. Why Table Manners Matter
                  Often the reason someone might be concerned about your table
                  manners isn't because your lack of manners bothers them.
                  Instead, they might be worried it bothers someone else. <br />
                  For instance, when you eat dinner with your friend's family
                  for the first time, s/he may not care that you behave like a
                  total buffoon at the table when you're just around him/her but
                  s/he may worry that the parents will be bothered by your poor
                  dining etiquette, because good manners are a sign of respect.
                  <br />
                  You may not practice perfect table manners at home but these
                  are needed when you eat out or have dinner in somebody's
                  house. <br />
                  That's also why nowadays employers will often take you out to
                  dinner as part of the interview process. Again, maybe the
                  hiring manager doesn't care if you have bad table manners, but
                  they may worry that your potential clients will be bothered
                  that you eat like an absent-minded caveman. <br />

                  1. Read the passage and answer the questions A and B. <br />
                  "We have a special responsibility to the ecosystem of this
                  planet. In making sure that other species survive we will be
                  ensuring the survival of our own." <br />
                  The first African woman and first environmentalist awarded the
                  Nobel Peace Prize. Wangari Maathai (1940-2011) received that
                  honour in 2004 as the founder of the Green Belt Movement in
                  Kenya, a nonprofit organization dedicated to planting trees,
                  environmental conservation, and women's rights. Maathai
                  introduced the idea of planting trees with the people and
                  developed it into a broad-based, grassroots organization
                  designed to conserve the environment and improve women's
                  quality of life. In 1986 the Green Belt Movement established a
                  Pan African Green Belt Network and introduced over 40
                  individuals from other African countries to its approach.{" "}
                  <br />
                  The Movement set both short and long-term objectives. The
                  overall aim has been to create public awareness of the need to
                  protect the environment through tree planting and sustainable
                  management. More specifically, it has initiatives to promote
                  and protect biodiversity, to protect the soil, to create jobs
                  especially in the rural areas, to give women a positive image
                  in the community and to assert their leadership qualities. It
                  promotes food security and assists people to make the link
                  between environmental degradation and many of the problems
                  they face, including poverty and livelihood insecurity. <br />
                  Over its past 20 years, many of the Movement's objectives have
                  been achieved. Environmental awareness has been greatly
                  increased in the world, and many women's groups have sold
                  millions of seedlings to the Movement, using the income to
                  meet immediate domestic needs such as education of their
                  children or investing it in other income-generating ventures.
                  Tree planting has become an honourable activity and many
                  people have adopted it. <br />
                  In later years Maathai's own work had focused on the human
                  rights situation in Kenya. Standing up for a democratic,
                  multi-ethnic Kenya, she was subjected to defamation,
                  persecution, detention and physical attacks. <br />
                  in Maathai received numerous awards and honorary degrees. Time
                  Magazine identified her as one of 100 most influential people
                  in the world in 2005, and Forbes Magazine as one of 100 most
                  powerful women in the world. In 2007 she was awarded the
                  Nelson Mandela Award for Health and Human Rights, 2010 the
                  Lions Humanitarian Award and the International Freedom Award.{" "}

                  She passed away from cancer in 2011, but her legacy continues
                  in many projects worldwide, such as in 'Plant for the Planet:

                  2. Based on your reading of the following passage, make short
                  notes in each of the boxes in the flow-chart showing the
                  purpose and objectives of the Green Belt Movement. (No. 1 has
                  been done for you.)2 × 5 = 10 <br />
                  The Movement set both short and long-term objectives. The
                  overall aim has been to create public awareness of the need to
                  protect the environment through tree planting and sustainable
                  management. More specifically, it has initiatives to promote
                  and protect biodiversity, to protect the soil, to create jobs
                  especially in the rural areas, to give women a positive image
                  in the community and to assert their leadership qualities. It
                  promotes food security and assists people to make the link
                  between environmental degradation and many of the problems
                  they face, including poverty and livelihood insecurity. <br />
