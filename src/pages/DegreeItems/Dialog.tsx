        <strong>Answer: </strong> A dialog between my friend Sumi and myself
        (Mim). <br />
        Sumi: How are you, Mim? Isn't it long since we met? <br />
        Mim: Yes, it is. I am well. <br />
        Sumi: But you seem to be anxious, but why? How is your preparation for
        the coming examination? <br />
        Mim: Well but English. But to be good at English is to do well (make
        good results) in the exam. Tell me the cause of failure in English (and
        how to make good results)? <br />
        Sumi: Well, English is a foreign language and our student is fearful of
        English, not to understand the importance of learning English is another
        reason of failure <br />
        in English. Mim: Then what's the importance of learning English? <br />
        Sumi: English is an international language. For communication, for being
        an expert doctor, engineer, politician and to get a good job, English is
        essential. <br />
        Mim: Then how to be good at English in order to get a good result in the
        examination. <br />
        Sumi: To be good at English one has to shake off the fear of English,
        build up vocabulary (and follow the rules-listening, speaking, writing
        and reading.....). <br />
        Mim: Thank you, Sumi, for your advice. <br />
        Sumi: Welcome. I wish you good results and see you again.
